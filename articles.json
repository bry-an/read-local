The poll revealed two-thirds (66%) of Americans agree that \\\"if a product is not easy/convenient for me to recycle, I probably would not recycle it.\\\" The poll also provides insights into ways these two sectors can better drive recycling.\\n\\n\\\"Understanding what is recyclable and what is not, can be confusing,\\\" said Robin Wiener, president of ISRI. \\\"The easier it is for people to understand if a product is recyclable, the more likely it is to make its way to the recycling stream. This includes not only making products that are easy to recycle through design for recycling and product labeling, but making recycling convenient through collection efforts.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to finding significance in the ease and convenience of recycling an item, the survey provided the following takeaways for brand owners:\\n\\n* The vast majority of Americans would like to see manufacturers and/or retailers display a \\\"Recycling Guide\\\" label on products (similar to the Energy Guide label on appliances) that would detail the parts and percentage of the product that could be recycled and how (81%). Having this information more prominent may help Americans consider these aspects of their product when making a purchase - or it could also encourage recycling of the product or package when disposing of it.\\n\\n* Younger Americans (aged 18-34) are more likely to consider the products packaging than older Americans (over 34) - including whether or not the packaging can be recycled (17%/11%), what the package is made of (16%/9%) and whether the package is made from recycled materials (16%/8%). This could be an important aspect for brands targeting the purchasing power of millennials.\\n\\n\\\"Promoting recycling goes far beyond corporate social responsibility for brands,\\\" said Wiener. \\\"This survey reveals that clearly indicating a products recyclability, as well as, the use of recyclable packaging could have a positive impact on a brand's bottom line. This makes good economic sense and is a win for the environment.\\\"\\n\\nThe survey also found government can also set an example for Americans by prioritizing recyclable materials. In fact, four in five Americans (80%) agree that governments at all levels should prioritize the use of recyclable products/material when making purchasing decisions. Recycling is demand driven, and thus increasing the use of recyclable materials in manufacturing is critical to the success of recycling. This is also an important takeaway for brands participating in the government procurement process.\\n\\nThe study also found 86% of U.S. adults agree recycling collection sites need to be more readily accessible to consumers.\\n\\nThe survey also looked at American's attitudes towards curbside collection programs. Detailed results are available online.\\n\\nSurvey Methodology\\n\\nThis survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of ISRI from September 17-19, 2018 among 2,003 U.S. adults. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de3566230"},"title":"\"Pacers relying on chemistry, upgrades to challenge in East\"","body":"\"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- All-Star guard Victor Oladipo promised to spend the offseason becoming a better all-around player.\\n\\nPromising young center Myles Turner beefed up, fine-tuned his defense and worked on his flexibility. Darren Collison, the NBA's 3-point percentage champ, continued working on his shooting touch, and the Indiana Pacers added depth to improve their chances of winning an NBA title.\\n\\nThe key to this season might actually be maintaining the selfless approach the Pacers used to emerge as one of last season's biggest surprises.\\n\\n\\\"We want to continue to build that culture,\\\" coach Nate McMillan said. \\\"We've been throwing that around a lot because I thought that was a big part of us having success last year -- creating an atmosphere in which we play together, an atmosphere of sacrifice. All that was created last year and we've got to do that again this season, I think, to have success.'\\n\\nIt's going to take more words to rekindle the togetherness they had last season when the Pacers proved everyone wrong about the Paul George trade. The preseason conventional wisdom was that Indiana, a perennial contender in the East with George, would struggle without him.\\n\\nInstead, after spending three seasons in relative obscurity in Orlando and one as Russell Westbrook's understudy in Oklahoma City, Oladipo showed everyone why the Magic took him with the No. 2 overall pick in 2013.\\n\\nHe became the Pacers' emotional floor leader, delivered a breakout season and nearly led the Pacers to a first-round upset of eventual conference champion Cleveland.\\n\\n\\\"We can't go back in time because if we could, I would change just a few things,\\\" Oladipo said. \\\"I've learned from it and it's helped me mentally and it's helped me physically and the same goes for my teammates as well.\\\"\\n\\nThe changes are already showing in the offseason work. Forward Thaddeus Young opted to stay in town largely because of the locker room atmosphere.\\n\\nWith all five starters back, the Pacers will see if they can pick up where they left off. Indiana opens the season at home Oct. 17 against Memphis.\\n\\n\\\"The No. 1 thing is developing the chemistry,\\\" president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said. \\\"I think that's what made last year's team so good was their chemistry, how they got along. That's a process you never know how that's going to go. But we're bringing back our top seven in terms of minutes played, so we hope we can keep that chemistry and continue to build on it.\\\"\\n\\nMYLES AND MYLES\\n\\nThe Pacers' biggest desires for Turner over his first three seasons was seeing him get stronger so he could become a better rebounder. It appears Turner has finally fulfilled those goals. The 6-foot-11, 250-pound center documented his offseason transition in photos on social media, and it didn't take his teammates long to see a difference when he reported to training camp.\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to push myself to new limits, push my body, push my game and push my mindset,\\\" Turner said. \\\"I've been at this for three years and now I see the improvements and things getting better. It's exciting.\\\"\\n\\nBENCH MARK\\n\\nWhile Indiana let Lance Stephenson leave in free agency, Pritchard made a concerted effort to improve the bench. He signed veteran guard Tyreke Evans, a more consistent shooter, and forward Doug McDermott to replace Stephenson's scoring touch. Indiana also added size with the additional of 6-10, 250-pound forward Kyle O'Quinn. Pritchard said he was most impressed with two qualities O'Quinn brings to the table -- a penchant for setting picks and grabbing rebounds.\\n\\nDE-FENSE\\n\\nOladipo was last season's NBA steals champ, and Indiana demonstrated its defensive prowess by consistently holding the Cavaliers below their scoring average in the playoffs. This season, they could be even better.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know if we have the individual pieces to be a great defensive team, but I think collectively we can be,\\\" Pritchard said.\\n\\nYOUNG PROGRESSION\\n\\nThe Pacers aren't just looking to long-time veterans for help this season. They're also expecting to get key contributions from forward TJ Leaf, their little-used first-round pick in 2017, and point guard Aaron Holiday, their top pick this summer.\\n\\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Indianapolis\"","lat":39,"lng":-86,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de3566231"},"title":"\"Grizzlies have high expectations with Gasol, healthy Conley\"","body":"\"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The Memphis Grizzlies know only too well that they won't outshoot or race up and down the court with the likes of Golden State and Houston. Their version of grit 'n grind that got them to seven straight playoff berths might not work with this current roster.\\n\\nBut Memphis still has guard Mike Conley and center Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies know who they are and that they need to play defense to be competitive in the loaded Western Conference.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to be a contrarian team, and we've had a lot of success here over the years in this grit-grind era of being a contrarian team,\\\" Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said.\\n\\nMost of the Grizzlies' confidence stems from having Conley back from a heel injury that limited him to 12 games last season , and Conley averaged 17.1 points per game in his short stint. Gasol remains one of the NBA's top centers, and he and Conley are the NBA's longest-tenured teammates without any interruption.\\n\\nMemphis revamped the roster in the offseason, swapping some youth for more experienced players. The miserable 22-60 season at least netted the Grizzlies the No. 4 overall pick on forward Jaren Jackson Jr. of Michigan State.\\n\\n\\\"It's good as long as they have the mindset of winning and improving and the growth mindset,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"I think the young guys bring a breath of fresh air, a new swag, they call it.\\\"\\n\\nSome other things to know about the Grizzlies who open this season Oct. 17 at Indiana:\\n\\nGASOL'S FUTURE\\n\\nThe 7-foot-1 center, who turns 34 in January, can opt out of his contract next summer holding a $25 million player option. Gasol has started 709 of the 716 games he's played for the Grizzlies, and this will be the 11th season for a three-time All-Star who has yet to play in the NBA Finals. The closest Gasol and Memphis came was the 2013 Western Finals before being swept by San Antonio.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot promise you anything, or what the future is,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"What I can tell you is how much I'm going to put in this season and how much I care about the success of the team.\\\"\\n\\nANOTHER NEW COACH\\n\\nJ.B. Bickerstaff has plenty of experience taking over as interim coach first in Houston and last season with the Grizzlies when David Fizdale was fired in late November. The Grizzlies gave him the job in May, and Bickerstaff had an entire offseason to pick his own assistants and plan for the season.\\n\\nHEALTHY PARSONS\\n\\nForward Chandler Parsons played 34 games in his first season with Memphis, and he managed 36 games last season for the Grizzlies. He averaged 7.9 points per game and shot a career-high 42.1 percent from 3-point range. The Grizzlies need more, and Parsons, who signed a four-year, $94 million contract with Memphis in 2016 , believes his knee issues are past him after playing with no limitations this summer.\\n\\n\\\"Let's face it the last two years have gone horribly and not the way I planned, but the reasons why I came to Memphis are still all intact and with J.B. as the coach and still able to play with Mike and Marc and the fan base we have here is the reason I came here,\\\" Parsons said. \\\"And they're all three still in play.\\\"\\n\\nTRIPLE-J\\n\\nThe Grizzlies have whiffed on many draft picks during their tenure in Memphis. Conley, the fourth overall pick in 2007, is the rare first-round selection who has thrived. The Grizzlies need Jackson, the Big Ten defensive player of the year last season, to live up to the promise shown in his summer league debut, and the 19-year-old forward understands the expectations he faces. He said he embraces the pressure to prove himself. \\\"You feel it inside you,\\\" Jackson said. \\\"You just got to show everybody else.\\\"\\n\\nNEW SUPPORTING CAST\\n\\nThe Grizzlies signed Kyle Anderson, who started 67 games last season for San Antonio, with being ready to take a big step forward after signing him to a three-year, $37.2 million offer sheet. They traded away Ben McLemore and Deyonta Davis to Sacramento for Garrett Temple, who set career-highs last season for both points per game and 3-point percentage. Omri Casspi shot 58 percent overall and 45.5 percent beyond the arc for Golden State last season, while Shelvin Mack averaged a career-high 4.9 assists last season with Orlando. They also drafted Jevon Carter, who won both Big 12 defensive player of the year and the new Naismith defensive player of the year award.\\n\\nFollow Teresa M.

It's the last time he'll try to fill them.\\n\\nFour years after aligning with James and Kyrie Irving in Cleveland to form a \\\"Big 3\\\" of stars that ended the city's five-decades-long championship drought by winning an NBA title in 2016, Love is the only one who remains with the Cavaliers.\\n\\nWhile James left for Los Angeles as a free agent this summer, and Irving forced his way to Boston via trade a year ago, Love has found a home -- and peace -- in Cleveland.\\n\\nBefore James announced that the next chapter of his career would be written in Hollywood, Love -- who had been the focus of trade rumors almost from the moment he arrived -- told the Cavs he was willing to lead.\\n\\n\\\"I'm staying,\\\" he informed general manager Koby Altman. \\\"I want to be a part of this.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This\\\" is life without James, the end of a historic four-year run and start of a rebuild as massive as the $140 million renovation taking place at Quicken Loans Arena, the Cavaliers' downtown home that is no longer one of the league's hottest spots with James gone.\\n\\nBut while the Cavs are no longer an elite team or national TV fixture, Love believes Cleveland's competitive days aren't done.\\n\\n\\\"We're going to be a team that surprises a lot of people,\\\" said Love, who signed a four-year, $120 million contract extension. \\\"(Coach) Ty Lue knows what he wants from us and vice versa. We have guys who have been here. We have guys who know how to win, knowing in losing the best player in the world we're going to have a fresh start.\\\"\\n\\nRelief.\\n\\nNone of the Cavaliers players, coaches or front-office members would ever use that word publicly to describe not having James. However, there is a sense of freedom that didn't exist while waiting and wondering about his next move.\\n\\nEverything will be different going forward for the Cavs, who must learn to play a different brand of ball.\\n\\n\\\"Life's going to be a lot different for us going forward, basketball-wise,\\\" veteran forward Kyle Korver said. \\\"We went to LeBron because we were supposed to go to LeBron. Now, there's an opportunity for new. No one is LeBron, but we get to figure out new things. We get to create a new identity.\\\"\\n\\nFor the 30-year-old Love, who last year revealed he has had anxiety issues, Cleveland's new situation is reminiscent of his six seasons in Minnesota. He was the focal point -- on and off the floor.\\n\\nHe is the main man again, and Love is relishing the chance to show he can still carry a franchise.\\n\\n\\\"I know what I'm capable of,\\\" he said. \\\"I was the second option last year, the third option a couple of years prior and I had to learn how to sacrifice. Now I'm considered the first option. It's a constant evolution. I'm heading into my 11th year, so I have to figure out with this team how it's going to affect us in the best way possible in order for us to win.\\\"\\n\\nYOUNG GUN\\n\\nThe Cavaliers are beyond excited about rookie guard Collin Sexton, the No. 8 overall pick. The former Alabama standout has impressed teammates with his attitude, tenacity and confidence. Upon arrival, he asked for No. 2 -- Irving's old number in Cleveland.\\n\\nSexton will begin the season coming off the bench behind George Hill, as the Cavs' preference is to ease him into his first season. However, it might not be long before he cracks Lue's starting lineup.\\n\\nThe knock on Sexton is his outside shooting, but his game is built on breaking down defenders and getting to the rim.\\n\\nTANKS, NO TANKS\\n\\nThe Cavs believe they can develop Sexton and other youngsters like Cedi Osman, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson and others while contending. It's a difficult path, but the team has no intention of following other franchises by losing and bottoming out to get lottery picks.\\n\\n\\\"No tanking,\\\" Lue said. \\\"You can see that with (owner) Dan (Gilbert) giving Kevin Love an extension. Not a rebuild at all. It's a challenge. We want to compete for the playoffs. It's not about wins and losses. It's about wins and lessons. These guys are going to have an opportunity to play meaningful games every night. Most of player development comes from playing games.\\\"\\n\\nThere is a price at staying competitive. Cleveland's first-round pick is protected if it's in the top 10, otherwise it goes to Atlanta.\\n\\nNEW LUE?\\n\\nLue feels re-energized after he was sidelined by health issues last season. He dealt with anxiety and insomnia during a drama-filled season that ended with Cleveland being swept in the Finals by Golden State.\\n\\nA longtime assistant, Lue is embracing the chance to mold young players and perhaps show he had something to do with the team's dominance the past few seasons.

Next came the surge.\\n\\nWith his legs churning and Texas pushing, Humphrey and the Longhorns moved the pile another 10 yards. The play picked up 19 yards, Texas converted on 4th-and-2 and finished the drive with a touchdown that would prove critical in a 48-45 win over Oklahoma.\\n\\nCoach Tom Herman called it \\\"the play of the game.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was a snapshot, a demonstration of our culture of toughness, our culture of not giving up,\\\" Herman said.\\n\\nIt was also the latest big play from Humphrey and Collin Johnson, two giants on the outside who have given Texas some of the biggest moments and touchdowns in a 5-1 start that has catapulted the Longhorns to the top of the Big 12 and their first top 10 ranking since 2010. Texas hosts Baylor on Saturday.\\n\\n\\\"I feel like we're one of the best receiver groups in the nation,\\\" Humphrey said. \\\"We can't be stopped at times, really at all.\\\"\\n\\nThe highlights of a five-game win streak would back that up. Humphrey and Johnson have combined for 65 catches and eight of the team's 12 passing touchdowns. Both had touchdown catches against Oklahoma and Humphrey even threw one to Johnson on the first possession; it came on a play named \\\"Jordan,\\\" with Humphrey lined up in the backfield for a direct snap and he faked a run before jumping and tossing the ball to Collins. With Humphrey a threat to run, no Sooner defender dropped off with Johnson, who was wide open in the end zone.

They (Oklahoma) thought LJ was going to run it in. You don't know what he's going to do.\\\"\\n\\nHerman has called Humphrey a \\\"Swiss Army knife\\\" kind of player who can do anything. Quarterback Sam Ehlinger has been able to count on Humphrey and Johnson to catch just about anything he throws their way, and usually with big results.\\n\\nThe two are a nightmare matchup for defensive backs: Johnson is 6-foot-6 and Humphrey is just 2 inches shorter. Humphrey consistently breaks tackles to pick up first downs while Johnson has a distinct advantage on jump balls. Ten of their 15 catches against Oklahoma resulted in first downs -- or touchdowns. Humphrey's 47-yard catch-and-run score against Southern Cal is Texas' longest offensive play of the season. Johnson's diving touchdown catch against TCU is maybe the most acrobatic.\\n\\nJohnson played every offensive snap against Kansas State and all but one against Oklahoma.

Michael had nothing holding it back.\\n\\n\\\"Everything was there for it to reach its potential and it did,\\\" Kossin said.\\n\\nAs Michael's eye started coming ashore, it boasted the third lowest central pressure of any storm to hit the United States, behind only a 1935 Labor Day storm and 1969's Camille.\\n\\nMeteorologists first got a sense something big could be happening by watching how Michael's eye changed shape. Early Tuesday, it was oddly shaped and ragged. Later in the morning it started to get better organized, and by Tuesday night real-time satellite imagery was showing the eye getting stronger and scarier by the minute.\\n\\nAnother factor: Its pressure, the measurement meteorologists use to gauge a hurricane's strength. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. Before landfall, Michael's pressure fell so low it looked like the winds were sure to pick up fast, said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for weathermodels.com.\\n\\nAnd none of the factors that hold a storm back were present, especially something called \\\"wind shear.\\\" Wind shear is when there's a mismatch either in speed or direction between winds near the surface and those five to six miles (8 to 10 kilometers) up.\\n\\nThat mismatch \\\"pushes the storm over\\\" or decapitates it, Kossin said. When the wind shear near Michael eased, the storm took off, he said.\\n\\n\\\"It's kind of like someone was holding on to it when it was trying to run and they let it go,\\\" Kossin said.\\n\\nAnother huge factor was the water temperature. Warm water is the energy that fuels hurricanes, and the Gulf water is 4 to 5 degrees warmer than normal.\\n\\nWater temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico vary along with weather, but some scientists said the warm waters are signs of human-caused climate change.\\n\\n\\\"Have humans contributed to how dangerous Michael is?\\\" Kossin said. \\\"Now we can look at how warm the waters are and that certainly has contributed to how intense Michael is and its intensification.\\\"\\n\\nThe warm waters, Kossin said, are a \\\"human fingerprint\\\" of climate change.\\n\\nKossin and others have a study out this month in the Journal of Climate with computer simulations showing that human-caused global warming will increase rapid intensification of tropical weather across the globe in the future.\\n\\nOther studies have shown rapid intensification has already increased over past decades. One study this year in Geophysical Research Letters found that since 1986, the rate of intensification of storms like Michael has increased by about 13 mph.\\n\\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de3566249"},"title":"\"Pacers relying on chemistry, upgrades to challenge in East\"","body":"\"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- All-Star guard Victor Oladipo promised to spend the offseason becoming a better all-around player.\\n\\nPromising young center Myles Turner beefed up, fine-tuned his defense and worked on his flexibility. Darren Collison, the NBA's 3-point percentage champ, continued working on his shooting touch, and the Indiana Pacers added depth to improve their chances of winning an NBA title.\\n\\nThe key to this season might actually be maintaining the selfless approach the Pacers used to emerge as one of last season's biggest surprises.\\n\\n\\\"We want to continue to build that culture,\\\" coach Nate McMillan said. \\\"We've been throwing that around a lot because I thought that was a big part of us having success last year -- creating an atmosphere in which we play together, an atmosphere of sacrifice. All that was created last year and we've got to do that again this season, I think, to have success.'\\n\\nIt's going to take more words to rekindle the togetherness they had last season when the Pacers proved everyone wrong about the Paul George trade. The preseason conventional wisdom was that Indiana, a perennial contender in the East with George, would struggle without him.\\n\\nInstead, after spending three seasons in relative obscurity in Orlando and one as Russell Westbrook's understudy in Oklahoma City, Oladipo showed everyone why the Magic took him with the No. 2 overall pick in 2013.\\n\\nHe became the Pacers' emotional floor leader, delivered a breakout season and nearly led the Pacers to a first-round upset of eventual conference champion Cleveland.\\n\\n\\\"We can't go back in time because if we could, I would change just a few things,\\\" Oladipo said. \\\"I've learned from it and it's helped me mentally and it's helped me physically and the same goes for my teammates as well.\\\"\\n\\nThe changes are already showing in the offseason work. Forward Thaddeus Young opted to stay in town largely because of the locker room atmosphere.\\n\\nWith all five starters back, the Pacers will see if they can pick up where they left off. Indiana opens the season at home Oct. 17 against Memphis.\\n\\n\\\"The No. 1 thing is developing the chemistry,\\\" president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said. \\\"I think that's what made last year's team so good was their chemistry, how they got along. That's a process you never know how that's going to go. But we're bringing back our top seven in terms of minutes played, so we hope we can keep that chemistry and continue to build on it.\\\"\\n\\nMYLES AND MYLES\\n\\nThe Pacers' biggest desires for Turner over his first three seasons was seeing him get stronger so he could become a better rebounder. It appears Turner has finally fulfilled those goals. The 6-foot-11, 250-pound center documented his offseason transition in photos on social media, and it didn't take his teammates long to see a difference when he reported to training camp.\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to push myself to new limits, push my body, push my game and push my mindset,\\\" Turner said. \\\"I've been at this for three years and now I see the improvements and things getting better. It's exciting.\\\"\\n\\nBENCH MARK\\n\\nWhile Indiana let Lance Stephenson leave in free agency, Pritchard made a concerted effort to improve the bench. He signed veteran guard Tyreke Evans, a more consistent shooter, and forward Doug McDermott to replace Stephenson's scoring touch. Indiana also added size with the additional of 6-10, 250-pound forward Kyle O'Quinn. Pritchard said he was most impressed with two qualities O'Quinn brings to the table -- a penchant for setting picks and grabbing rebounds.\\n\\nDE-FENSE\\n\\nOladipo was last season's NBA steals champ, and Indiana demonstrated its defensive prowess by consistently holding the Cavaliers below their scoring average in the playoffs. This season, they could be even better.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know if we have the individual pieces to be a great defensive team, but I think collectively we can be,\\\" Pritchard said.\\n\\nYOUNG PROGRESSION\\n\\nThe Pacers aren't just looking to long-time veterans for help this season. They're also expecting to get key contributions from forward TJ Leaf, their little-used first-round pick in 2017, and point guard Aaron Holiday, their top pick this summer.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Indianapolis\"","lat":39,"lng":-86,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de356624a"},"title":"\"LeBron-less Cavaliers starting anew with Love as focal point | FOX Sports\"","body":"\"CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kevin Love wore a pair of LeBron James' signature sneakers on media day. It's the last time he'll try to fill them.\\n\\nFour years after aligning with James and Kyrie Irving in Cleveland to form a \\\"Big 3\\\" of stars that ended the city's five-decades-long championship drought by winning an NBA title in 2016, Love is the only one who remains with the Cavaliers.\\n\\nWhile James left for Los Angeles as a free agent this summer, and Irving forced his way to Boston via trade a year ago, Love has found a home -- and peace -- in Cleveland.\\n\\nBefore James announced that the next chapter of his career would be written in Hollywood, Love -- who had been the focus of trade rumors almost from the moment he arrived -- told the Cavs he was willing to lead.\\n\\n\\\"I'm staying,\\\" he informed general manager Koby Altman. \\\"I want to be a part of this.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This\\\" is life without James, the end of a historic four-year run and start of a rebuild as massive as the $140 million renovation taking place at Quicken Loans Arena, the Cavaliers' downtown home that is no longer one of the league's hottest spots with James gone.\\n\\nBut while the Cavs are no longer an elite team or national TV fixture, Love believes Cleveland's competitive days aren't done.\\n\\n\\\"We're going to be a team that surprises a lot of people,\\\" said Love, who signed a four-year, $120 million contract extension. \\\"(Coach) Ty Lue knows what he wants from us and vice versa. We have guys who have been here. We have guys who know how to win, knowing in losing the best player in the world we're going to have a fresh start.\\\"\\n\\nRelief.\\n\\nNone of the Cavaliers players, coaches or front-office members would ever use that word publicly to describe not having James. However, there is a sense of freedom that didn't exist while waiting and wondering about his next move.\\n\\nEverything will be different going forward for the Cavs, who must learn to play a different brand of ball.\\n\\n\\\"Life's going to be a lot different for us going forward, basketball-wise,\\\" veteran forward Kyle Korver said. \\\"We went to LeBron because we were supposed to go to LeBron. Now, there's an opportunity for new. No one is LeBron, but we get to figure out new things. We get to create a new identity.\\\"\\n\\nFor the 30-year-old Love, who last year revealed he has had anxiety issues, Cleveland's new situation is reminiscent of his six seasons in Minnesota. He was the focal point -- on and off the floor.\\n\\nHe is the main man again, and Love is relishing the chance to show he can still carry a franchise.\\n\\n\\\"I know what I'm capable of,\\\" he said. \\\"I was the second option last year, the third option a couple of years prior and I had to learn how to sacrifice. Now I'm considered the first option. It's a constant evolution. I'm heading into my 11th year, so I have to figure out with this team how it's going to affect us in the best way possible in order for us to win.\\\"\\n\\nYOUNG GUN\\n\\nThe Cavaliers are beyond excited about rookie guard Collin Sexton, the No. 8 overall pick. The former Alabama standout has impressed teammates with his attitude, tenacity and confidence. Upon arrival, he asked for No. 2 -- Irving's old number in Cleveland.\\n\\nSexton will begin the season coming off the bench behind George Hill, as the Cavs' preference is to ease him into his first season. However, it might not be long before he cracks Lue's starting lineup.\\n\\nThe knock on Sexton is his outside shooting, but his game is built on breaking down defenders and getting to the rim.\\n\\nTANKS, NO TANKS\\n\\nThe Cavs believe they can develop Sexton and other youngsters like Cedi Osman, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson and others while contending. It's a difficult path, but the team has no intention of following other franchises by losing and bottoming out to get lottery picks.\\n\\n\\\"No tanking,\\\" Lue said. \\\"You can see that with (owner) Dan (Gilbert) giving Kevin Love an extension. Not a rebuild at all. It's a challenge. We want to compete for the playoffs. It's not about wins and losses. It's about wins and lessons. These guys are going to have an opportunity to play meaningful games every night. Most of player development comes from playing games.\\\"\\n\\nThere is a price at staying competitive. Cleveland's first-round pick is protected if it's in the top 10, otherwise it goes to Atlanta.\\n\\nNEW LUE?\\n\\nLue feels re-energized after he was sidelined by health issues last season. He dealt with anxiety and insomnia during a drama-filled season that ended with Cleveland being swept in the Finals by Golden State.\\n\\nA longtime assistant, Lue is embracing the chance to mold young players and perhaps show he had something to do with the team's dominance the past few seasons. It wasn't all about James.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Cleveland\"","lat":41,"lng":-81,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de356624b"},"title":"\"Grizzlies have high expectations with Gasol, healthy Conley\"","body":"\"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The Memphis Grizzlies know only too well that they won't outshoot or race up and down the court with the likes of Golden State and Houston. Their version of grit 'n grind that got them to seven straight playoff berths might not work with this current roster.\\n\\nBut Memphis still has guard Mike Conley and center Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies know who they are and that they need to play defense to be competitive in the loaded Western Conference.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to be a contrarian team, and we've had a lot of success here over the years in this grit-grind era of being a contrarian team,\\\" Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said.\\n\\nMost of the Grizzlies' confidence stems from having Conley back from a heel injury that limited him to 12 games last season , and Conley averaged 17.1 points per game in his short stint. Gasol remains one of the NBA's top centers, and he and Conley are the NBA's longest-tenured teammates without any interruption.\\n\\nMemphis revamped the roster in the offseason, swapping some youth for more experienced players. The miserable 22-60 season at least netted the Grizzlies the No. 4 overall pick on forward Jaren Jackson Jr. of Michigan State.\\n\\n\\\"It's good as long as they have the mindset of winning and improving and the growth mindset,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"I think the young guys bring a breath of fresh air, a new swag, they call it.\\\"\\n\\nSome other things to know about the Grizzlies who open this season Oct. 17 at Indiana:\\n\\nGASOL'S FUTURE\\n\\nThe 7-foot-1 center, who turns 34 in January, can opt out of his contract next summer holding a $25 million player option. Gasol has started 709 of the 716 games he's played for the Grizzlies, and this will be the 11th season for a three-time All-Star who has yet to play in the NBA Finals. The closest Gasol and Memphis came was the 2013 Western Finals before being swept by San Antonio.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot promise you anything, or what the future is,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"What I can tell you is how much I'm going to put in this season and how much I care about the success of the team.\\\"\\n\\nANOTHER NEW COACH\\n\\nJ.B. Bickerstaff has plenty of experience taking over as interim coach first in Houston and last season with the Grizzlies when David Fizdale was fired in late November. The Grizzlies gave him the job in May, and Bickerstaff had an entire offseason to pick his own assistants and plan for the season.\\n\\nHEALTHY PARSONS\\n\\nForward Chandler Parsons played 34 games in his first season with Memphis, and he managed 36 games last season for the Grizzlies. He averaged 7.9 points per game and shot a career-high 42.1 percent from 3-point range. The Grizzlies need more, and Parsons, who signed a four-year, $94 million contract with Memphis in 2016 , believes his knee issues are past him after playing with no limitations this summer.\\n\\n\\\"Let's face it the last two years have gone horribly and not the way I planned, but the reasons why I came to Memphis are still all intact and with J.B. as the coach and still able to play with Mike and Marc and the fan base we have here is the reason I came here,\\\" Parsons said. \\\"And they're all three still in play.\\\"\\n\\nTRIPLE-J\\n\\nThe Grizzlies have whiffed on many draft picks during their tenure in Memphis. Conley, the fourth overall pick in 2007, is the rare first-round selection who has thrived. The Grizzlies need Jackson, the Big Ten defensive player of the year last season, to live up to the promise shown in his summer league debut, and the 19-year-old forward understands the expectations he faces. He said he embraces the pressure to prove himself. \\\"You feel it inside you,\\\" Jackson said. \\\"You just got to show everybody else.\\\"\\n\\nNEW SUPPORTING CAST\\n\\nThe Grizzlies signed Kyle Anderson, who started 67 games last season for San Antonio, with being ready to take a big step forward after signing him to a three-year, $37.2 million offer sheet. They traded away Ben McLemore and Deyonta Davis to Sacramento for Garrett Temple, who set career-highs last season for both points per game and 3-point percentage. Omri Casspi shot 58 percent overall and 45.5 percent beyond the arc for Golden State last season, while Shelvin Mack averaged a career-high 4.9 assists last season with Orlando. They also drafted Jevon Carter, who won both Big 12 defensive player of the year and the new Naismith defensive player of the year award.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Teresa M.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said Nielsen's assertion under oath that her department doesn't detain children appeared in conflict with an inspector general's report Sept. 27 that children were detained and for longer than the 72 hours allowed by statute.\\n\\nThe report found that 27 percent of the children detained by Customs and Border Protection in the Rio Grande Valley sector and 23 percent in the El Paso sector were held for longer than five days. In one case, a child was held in the Rio Grande sector for 25 days. Nielsen's denial of detaining children contrasted with pictures and video during the summer of children in chain-link cages at CBP facilities.\\n\\n\\\"Not only has CBP detained children, it has detained them for longer than is statutorily allowed,\\\" Nielsen said at a Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing. \\\"How do you reconcile the IG report with your testimony?\\\"\\n\\nNielsen said CBP processes children with medical screening and then transfers them to the Department of Health and Human Services. But because of the large influx, HHS sometimes isn't able to receive children immediately, she said.\\n\\n\\\"It's not detention facilities,\\\" Nielsen said at her first hearing since the zero-tolerance policy focused attention on the issue. \\\"We are not able to, under the law, put them anywhere else.\\\"\\n\\nThe number of immigrant children who arrived alone or with relatives sometimes overwhelmed the government's ability to process and detain them.\\n\\n\\\"In order words, we do not have detention facilities at DHS for 10,000 children who were sent here unaccompanied - and their parents chose to do that,\\\" Nielsen said.\\n\\nDuring Nielsen's opening statement, about a dozen protesters stood to protest family separations at the border. The protesters remained silent, but some donned shiny blankets and some held signs that said, \\\"Families Belong Together\\\" before police ushered them out.\\n\\nThe administration is trying to complete a court-ordered process to reunite more than 2,500 families that were separated under President Donald Trump's \\\"zero-tolerance\\\" policy.\\n\\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy in April, which required that all people apprehended trying to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border were to be charged with a criminal violation and sent to immigration detention centers or federal prisons to await deportation hearings.\\n\\nBefore, most of those cases were treated as civil violations. That change prompted the government to detain those parents in separate facilities from their children, due to a U.S. law and a 1997 court settlement, known as the Flores Settlement, that limits the detention of children to no more than 20 days.\\n\\nThe policy was widely condemned, and the president signed an executive order June 20 ending the practice. A week later, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that the practice may have violated the due process rights of the families and ordered the administration to reunite them within 30 days.\\n\\nBy Oct. 5, 104 children waited to be reunited with their parents, according to the committee.\\n\\nThe committee released statistics showing that 2,654 children had been separated from their parents under the zero-tolerance policy. The panel said 2,337 had been reunited with parents, other relatives or family friends. The Department of Health and Human Services has 166 children whose parents were red-flagged or deported and wanted the children to remain. Another 47 children were found not to be separated, according to the panel.\\n\\n\\\"How long is too long to detain a child?\\\" asked Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich.\\n\\nNielsen said HHS detains children rather than DHS. But she said sometimes it takes longer to find relatives or sponsors in the United States to receive the children.\\n\\n\\\"In general, the answer is as short amount of time as possible,\\\" Nielsen said. \\\"I am concerned that we need to take the best care of them that we can, to place them with a family member or sponsor as soon as possible.\\\"\\n\\nThe criticism wasn't universal on the panel. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., commended Nielsen for caring for the children.\\n\\n\\\"You're actually trying to be able to manage and provide care to kids that have not had care sometimes from their own parents, sometimes at all from anyone, for weeks at that point,\\\" Lankford said. \\\"You're putting a positive face forward for America to be able to help provide care for kids who are in a vulnerable moment.

The poll revealed two-thirds (66%) of Americans agree that \\\"if a product is not easy/convenient for me to recycle, I probably would not recycle it.\\\" The poll also provides insights into ways these two sectors can better drive recycling.\\n\\n\\\"Understanding what is recyclable and what is not, can be confusing,\\\" said Robin Wiener, president of ISRI. \\\"The easier it is for people to understand if a product is recyclable, the more likely it is to make its way to the recycling stream. This includes not only making products that are easy to recycle through design for recycling and product labeling, but making recycling convenient through collection efforts.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to finding significance in the ease and convenience of recycling an item, the survey provided the following takeaways for brand owners:\\n\\n* The vast majority of Americans would like to see manufacturers and/or retailers display a \\\"Recycling Guide\\\" label on products (similar to the Energy Guide label on appliances) that would detail the parts and percentage of the product that could be recycled and how (81%). Having this information more prominent may help Americans consider these aspects of their product when making a purchase - or it could also encourage recycling of the product or package when disposing of it.\\n\\n* Younger Americans (aged 18-34) are more likely to consider the products packaging than older Americans (over 34) - including whether or not the packaging can be recycled (17%/11%), what the package is made of (16%/9%) and whether the package is made from recycled materials (16%/8%). This could be an important aspect for brands targeting the purchasing power of millennials.\\n\\n\\\"Promoting recycling goes far beyond corporate social responsibility for brands,\\\" said Wiener. \\\"This survey reveals that clearly indicating a products recyclability, as well as, the use of recyclable packaging could have a positive impact on a brand's bottom line. This makes good economic sense and is a win for the environment.\\\"\\n\\nThe survey also found government can also set an example for Americans by prioritizing recyclable materials. In fact, four in five Americans (80%) agree that governments at all levels should prioritize the use of recyclable products/material when making purchasing decisions. Recycling is demand driven, and thus increasing the use of recyclable materials in manufacturing is critical to the success of recycling. This is also an important takeaway for brands participating in the government procurement process.\\n\\nThe study also found 86% of U.S. adults agree recycling collection sites need to be more readily accessible to consumers.\\n\\nThe survey also looked at American's attitudes towards curbside collection programs. Detailed results are available online.\\n\\nSurvey Methodology\\n\\nThis survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of ISRI from September 17-19, 2018 among 2,003 U.S. adults. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

The benevolent Caitlin Weierhauser -- 2017 Portland's Funniest Person, host of the Mercury's I, Anonymous show, and founding member of local comedy collective Lez Stand Up -- reigned confidently and with kindness over Portland's comedy scene these past few years. Hers was the disposition of a charming uncle with compelling stories, sharp jokes, and an irate bemusement at Portland's enduring weird. But things are picking up for our Uncle Cait. She's in the upcoming film, Timmy Failure, which will debut with Disney's upcoming streaming service. And at a summer comedy showcase Just For Laughs, New Faces: Unrepped Weierhauser finally gained representation. Now she's heading south to LA, in search of career glory. Weierhauser was kind enough to agree to an exit interview, during which the Mercury employed last-ditch emotional blackmail in an effort to get her to stay.\\n\\nMERCURY: All my questions are some variation of \\\"Why are you leaving? They won't appreciate you.\\\"\\n\\nWEIERHAUSER: It's true. Okay well, doing stand-up is one piece of a hopeful career in entertainment. Stand-up is accessible and easy to get into and the entry point is wide-open, but if you want to stay in it and hopefully build some kind of career in acting or writing or continuing stand-up there's only so much you can do in a place like Portland. It's a great way to get into comedy. It's one big piece, but not the only piece.\\n\\nPeople love love love to ask, \\\"Are you full time? Are you professional?\\\" Having a day job is considered, like, \\\"I guess you're not taking it seriously then.\\\" And I'm like, \\\"Oh no! Oh no no no no.\\\" I'm doing stand-up every night. But there's not enough money here to sustain an eating and rent-paying habit.\\n\\nWhat film about a bright-eyed young thing moving to LA do you predict your move will most resemble?\\n\\nI hope it's a transition from Slums of Beverly Hills to Clueless.\\n\\nWas this always the plan? Was it always 1) Stand-up 2) Disney movie 3) LA?\\n\\nThere's a collective knowledge base in stand-up. People that have more experience will sometimes let you pick their brains. I have been fortunate to work with some caring, invested headliners. If you're smart at all, you listen to people that have gone before you.\\n\\nStudies have shown that people are happiest when they live in mid-sized cities near water. Why don't you want to be happy?\\n\\nThis seems like as good a time as any to give you an opportunity to air grievances with the city of Portland. You can name names.\\n\\nGood before the bad, the audiences here are just incredible. I have more fun with people in Portland than I do anywhere else. They will come with you on the most insane premises.\\n\\nAs a person living in Portland, oh my goodness. It drives me nuts how nervous and non-confrontational everyone is all the time! It makes me so uncomfortable. A whole city of socially awkward people and then the three people on the street that aren't socially awkward SHOULD BE because they're up to so much. There's no middle ground.\\n\\nDo you greet people on the street? Do you make eye contact?\\n\\nAs necessary. When I say non-confrontational I mean like directly in response to something wild happening. People are so afraid of looking at, acknowledging, and talking to each other. No one would speak up and say like, \\\"Pajamas are unacceptable [to wear out]. I'm sorry.\\\"\\n\\nAny college town has a problem with people wearing pajamas. Are you just mad at the crunchy? Are you talking about the men wearing full camo gear and like a billion tiny mirrors in front of their face so they can see what's behind them?\\n\\nYeah and no one will be like, \\\"You look so dumb! What are you doing? NERD.\\\" You do have to seek to find something to hate about Portland, but I've done my work.\\n\\nI've heard you call Portland \\\"sensitive\\\" in your stand-up. Are we too sensitive? Is that why you're leaving us?\\n\\nPortland is sensitive. And I like the sensitivity. Portland can be overly-empathetic, which can be a little frustrating when you're performing because any mention of struggle or hardship whatsoever and you just get a sea of \\\"AWWWWWWW.\\\" And you're like, \\\"No, I'm fine! Let's get through this. Don't fall apart on me. We just started!\\\"\\n\\nAre there jokes you cut in Portland because they're too empathy-inducing?\\n\\nIt's more a matter of finesse. I tell this story about going skydiving and being embarrassed and I've had to tweak it to find that balance.

Portland audiences, my goodness.\\n\\nThat's like podcast length. But Portlanders love podcasts.\\n\\n[Weierhauser screams with affection and frustration]\\n\\nHow do you write stand-up?

One of the things about coming up in stand-up -- and I don't think it's specific to Portland -- was being called \\\"intimidating.\\\" It was one of my favorite things in the world.

What are you doing?\\\"\\n\\nDo you think Portland is changing?\\n\\nThe city is updating. I don't know how radical the change is. Considering the last five years, I think the five years before that were far more radical.

Entre les rayonnages où s'amoncèlent les livres sur la révolution russe de 1917 et la Commune de Paris de 1870, Gramsci côtoie Michel Foucault, lequel voisine avec Derrida. La seconde édition du livre collectif de l'Union juive française pour la paix (UJFP), Une Parole juive contre le racisme, trône sans trancher avec tous ces ouvrages pointus de philosophie politique.\\n\\n\\\" Le racisme, est-ce une simple affaire d'individus, voire de groupes ? N'est-ce pas plutôt un outil utilisé par le pouvoir pour dominer ? \\\"\\n\\n- Extrait d'Une Parole juive contre le racisme\\n\\nLa seconde édition de ce livre tient tout autant du manifeste sur l'antiracisme politique que du manuel didactique à l'intention du personnel éducatif et des jeunes Français, public à qui il est d'abord destiné.\\n\\nDans cet essai, l'UJFP ne dissocie pas la question palestinienne de la problématique du racisme en France. Elle parvient même à les articuler dans une réflexion qui interroge autant la diplomatie de la France que sa politique vis-à-vis de ses minorités, quelles qu'elles soient.\\n\\nL'UJFP est une association qui s'est donnée pour ligne, comme il est rappelé dès l'introduction du livre, de \\\" soutenir les droits de tous les êtres vivant en Israël et dans les territoires occupés palestiniens, voulant porter une parole juive dont nous ressentions être privés par la prétention des dirigeants d'Israël de parler au nom des juifs du monde entier \\\".\\n\\nDès l'introduction, le livre précise : c'est \\\" la montée du racisme \\\" qui a conduit l'UJFP à \\\" défendre en même temps ces mêmes droits humains ici et maintenant en France \\\". Et si, selon l'association, \\\" l'antisémitisme n'a pas disparu \\\", \\\" nous devons aussi constater que les principales victimes du racisme ne sont plus les juifs [...] quand l'islamophobie se déchaîne, quand la négrophobie est quotidienne [...] \\\".\\n\\nL'ouvrage le revendique ainsi clairement : \\\" la lutte contre le racisme est indivisible \\\".\\n\\n\\\" L'UJFP se bat contre le racisme et non pas contre le racisme et l'antisémitisme \\\", explique le coordinateur du livre, Dominique Natanson. \\\" Cette dissociation suppose qu'il y aurait, à cause de la Shoah, un racisme suprême, l'antisémitisme. Nous refusons ainsi ce distinguo [...]. \\\"\\n\\n\\\" [...] les principales victimes du racisme ne sont plus les juifs [...] quand l'islamophobie se déchaîne, quand la négrophobie est quotidienne [...] \\\".\\n\\n- Extrait d'Une Parole juive contre le racisme\\n\\nUne Parole juive contre le racisme aborde de front les questions qui font depuis quelques années vaciller, voire trembler, la France sur son socle républicain du \\\" vivre-ensemble \\\". \\\" Le racisme, est-ce une simple affaire d'individus, voire de groupes ? N'est-ce pas plutôt un outil utilisé par le pouvoir pour dominer ? \\\", interrogent les auteurs.\\n\\nPour l'UJFP, la lutte contre le racisme n'est pas une simple affaire morale, réduite à la peur, l'ignorance ou la bêtise de chacun, mais une véritable problématique politique. Cette démarche suppose de montrer et dénoncer les mécanismes de pouvoir qui jouent de ce racisme. Voire le favorisent. Et dans les cas extrêmes, en tirent leur propre légitimation.\\n\\nAutre point sur lequel s'engage fermement l'UJFP, la distinction entre antisémitisme et antisionisme. \\\" Fondamentalement, l'antisionisme, c'est l'idée que le sionisme a créé une société raciste et discriminatoire. Et qu'une paix fondée sur l'égalité des droits est antinomique avec l'existence d'États basés sur l'origine ethnique ou la religion \\\", rappelle Une Parole juive contre le racisme.\\n\\n\\\" [...] dans les quartiers populaires et au-delà, se développe un anti-israélisme, c'est-à-dire un rejet profond de la politique coloniale et discriminatoire envers le peuple palestinien menée par l'État d'Israël \\\", précise le livre.\\n\\n\\\" Parfois, cette opposition [à Israël] s'exprime comme une opposition aux juifs, tant Israël se prétend l'État des juifs du monde entier, que les représentants les plus médiatiques de la ''communauté'' juive soutiennent cet État dans toutes ses actions y compris criminelles, et que les dirigeants de notre propre pays s'opposent à toute sanction contre cet État \\\"\\n\\n- Extrait d'Une Parole juive contre le racisme\\n\\n\\\" Il est vrai que parfois, cette opposition s'exprime comme une opposition aux juifs, tant Israël se prétend l'État des juifs du monde entier, que les représentants les plus médiatiques de la ''communauté'' juive soutiennent cet État dans toutes ses actions y compris criminelles, et que les dirigeants de notre propre pays s'opposent à toute sanction contre cet État, pratiquant un ''deux poids, deux mesures'' \\\".\\n\\nPour Dominique Natanson, \\\" si les préjugés antisémites existent dans la société française, ils sont en très forte régression. Les sondages montrent que les juifs, parmi tous les racisés, sont la catégorie la moins rejetée. [...] Toute cette théorie de ''nouvel antisémitisme'' est basée sur la défense d'Israël, car elle suppose que toute critique d'Israël est antisémite. Pourtant, un sondage récent a montré que la catégorie politique la moins touchée par l'antisémitisme est celle qui est la plus critique envers la politique d'Israël \\\".\\n\\nPour celui qui fut aussi le co-président de l'UJFP, cette idée que la critique de l'État d'Israël serait par nature antisioniste puis, par glissement, antisémite, trouverait ses racines dans l'impérialisme occidental : \\\" J'ai longtemps pensé qu'il y avait une culpabilité occidentale qui expliquerait le soutien occidental à Israël. Je pense désormais que ce soutien tient à des questions impérialistes. Israël est faible et chaque fois qu'il s'est fait taper sur les doigts par ses protecteurs occidentaux, il a obtempéré.\\n\\n\\\" Les Israéliens ont peur de ne plus avoir peur. [...] La peur est un ciment pour ce pays, sinon il imploserait \\\"\\n\\n- Dominique Natanson, ex co-président de l'UJFP\\n\\n\\\" En outre, les Israéliens ont peur de ne plus avoir peur. Ils voient même de l'antisémitisme dans des manifestations pacifiques, comme récemment à Gaza. La peur est un ciment pour ce pays, sinon il imploserait. \\\"\\n\\nLe mot \\\" apartheid \\\" est aussi utilisé dans Une Parole juive contre le racisme pour qualifier le sort fait aux Palestiniens. \\\" Des faits en Palestine rappellent ce crime, estime Dominique Natanson. La ségrégation spatiale, la création de zones qui pourrait s'apparenter à des bantoustans. Si on rapporte les financements publics aux habitants, les Arabes israéliens reçoivent 4 % alors qu'ils sont 20 % de la population.\\n\\nÀ LIRE ► INTERVIEW - Dominique Vidal : confondre antisionisme et antisémitisme est une \\\" erreur majeure \\\"\\n\\n\\\" La ségrégation est diffuse. Par exemple, les Arabes de citoyenneté israélienne sont dispensés du service militaire. Or, pour certains emplois, accès à des bourses universitaires, il y a obligation de l'avoir effectué. \\\"\\n\\nLes positions de l'UJFP tranchent ainsi nettement avec celles du Conseil représentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF), l'autre voix juive, jugée en France \\\" représentative \\\". Mais l'est-elle vraiment ?\\n\\n\\\" Beaucoup [de juifs français] pensent que la voie de Netanyahou est une erreur mais n'osent pas en parler publiquement. Pourtant, aux États-Unis, les digues sont rompues et certains juifs américains sont très critiques de la politique israélienne \\\"\\n\\n- Dominique Natanson, ex co-président de l'UJFP\\n\\nDominique Natanson relève que \\\" peut-être un quart des juifs se reconnaissent dans les positions du CRIF ; mais même là, cela est difficile à dire car les statistiques ethniques sont interdites en France \\\".\\n\\nUne vraie évolution idéologique et dans le soutien à Israël s'est observée chez les juifs de France, note-t-il. \\\" Longtemps, ils ont été plutôt de gauche, très antiracistes. Après 1967, il y eut comme un engouement autour de la défense d'Israël chez les juifs de France. On a aussi observé une droitisation du CRIF, qui est passé de Théo Klein à une proximité avec les idées d'extrême droite. Lors de la manifestation pour la mémoire de Mireille Knoll, ceux qui ont protégé Marine Le Pen portait un écusson de la police des frontières israéliennes. \\\"\\n\\nLe militant observe par ailleurs comme une \\\" impasse \\\" dans laquelle se trouveraient ses concitoyens de confession juive : \\\" Ils sont sensibles à la distorsion de leurs valeurs par rapport à ce qui se passe en Israël. Beaucoup pensent que la voie de Netanyahou est une erreur mais n'osent pas en parler publiquement. Pourtant, aux États-Unis, les digues sont rompues et certains juifs américains sont très critiques de la politique israélienne. \\\"\\n\\nÀ LIRE ► Pas en mon nom\\n\\nDu fait de ses positions, l'UJFP crispe. Dès la première édition d'Une Parole juive contre le racisme, le CRIF envoie une lettre à Manuel Valls, alors Premier ministre, pour se plaindre des subventions publiques qu'il a reçues, précise Dominique Natanson.\\n\\nL'UJFP obtient toutefois une nouvelle subvention du CGET (Commissariat général à l'égalité des territoires) pour publier la seconde édition et réaliser des clips de sensibilisation sur le racisme à destination du jeune public.\\n\\nCependant, raconte Dominique Natanson, \\\" le CGET a été furieux en raison de la notion de racisme d'État qui est abordée dans le livre. Il a demandé à ce que soit retiré son logo des clips et a demandé le remboursement de la subvention [...] \\\". Une décision contestée par l'UJFP devant le tribunal administratif.\\n\\nD'autres pressions auraient eu lieu, notamment, \\\" des coups de fils pour dissuader un lycée de recevoir l'UJFP pour une intervention sur le livre \\\".\\n\\nPatrick Silberstein, éditeur du livre au sein de la maison d'édition Syllepse, défend la démarche de l'UJFP. Une démarche nécessaire, selon lui, pour \\\" reconstruire la lutte antiraciste \\\".\\n\\n\\\" Le racisme inter-racisé est aussi le résultat du racisme d'État. À nous de construire notre propre mécanisme pour ne pas reproduire ce mécanisme institutionnel, car le racisme est d'abord une affaire de domination \\\"\\n\\n- Saimir Mile, La Voix des Rroms\\n\\n\\\" Cette reconstruction n'est possible que si les racisés s'emparent de cette question et s'auto-organisent, explique-t-il. On a appris de la question noire aux États-Unis qu'il fallait passer par une phase de séparation : hommes noirs ensemble, femmes noires ensemble... car chacun porte des problématiques singulières. Chaque groupe doit s'organiser en autonomie puis, de cette organisation, doit naître un mouvement unitaire \\\", estime-t-il.\\n\\nUn mouvement unitaire ? C'est aussi ce qu'appelle de ses vœux Omar Slaouti, militant antiraciste. Pour lui, la lutte antiraciste est désormais la question politique centrale. \\\" Même quand on parle de Parcours Sup, par exemple, on en revient au voile de Maryam Pougetoux, laquelle a été renvoyée à son voile. Il y a une crispation identitaire qui se traduit par des lois. Les gouvernements sociaux-libéraux ont fait le choix de cette crispation identitaire pour mieux évacuer la question sociale. \\\"\\n\\nPour Omar Slaouti, cette lutte transversale concerne tout le monde : \\\" [...] il faut élargir à d'autres questions : les services publics, les conditions de travail. Un même individu peut subir un ensemble d'exploitations. Mais l'exploitation subie par tous peut être vécue autrement tout en bas de l'échelle si on est racisé. [...] Il n'y a pas de césure entre la lutte raciale et la lutte sociale \\\".\\n\\nÀ LIRE ► \\\" Est-ce que tu vis dans un arbre ? \\\" : chronique d'un racisme ordinaire en Tunisie\\n\\nMême analyse pour Saimir Mile de La Voix des Rroms, pour qui \\\" il faut séparer les luttes pour mieux les réunir \\\". Des travaux de réflexion sont ainsi menés entre l'UJFP, le Collectif contre l'islamophobie en France (CCIF), la Voix des Rroms et d'autres associations sur la rénovation de la lutte politique contre le racisme.\\n\\nPour Saimir Mile, il s'agit aussi de poser la question du racisme inter-racisés. Négrophobie chez les Arabes, romophobie chez les Arabes et les noirs... et les Roms qui disent \\\" avoir peur des noirs et des terroristes \\\". Selon lui, \\\" le racisme inter-racisé est aussi le résultat du racisme d'État.

Selon lui, cela est aussi dangereux qu'\\\" assimiler tous les juifs à l'État d'Israël, on crée ainsi de l'antisémitisme. Le rôle de l'UJFP est important pour montrer que cela est faux. \\\"\\n\\n\\\" Le problème, relève toutefois Omar Slaouti, c'est qu'on n'entend pas suffisamment cette autre voix juive dans les médias. \\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Paris\"","lat":48,"lng":2,"__v":0}

That's how strong a storm can get if all other factors are aligned, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and hurricane expert Jim Kossin said. Michael had nothing holding it back.\\n\\n\\\"Everything was there for it to reach its potential and it did,\\\" Kossin said.\\n\\nAs Michael's eye started coming ashore, it boasted the third lowest central pressure of any storm to hit the United States, behind only a 1935 Labor Day storm and 1969's Camille.\\n\\nMeteorologists first got a sense something big could be happening by watching how Michael's eye changed shape. Early Tuesday, it was oddly shaped and ragged. Later in the morning it started to get better organized, and by Tuesday night real-time satellite imagery was showing the eye getting stronger and scarier by the minute.\\n\\nAnother factor: Its pressure, the measurement meteorologists use to gauge a hurricane's strength. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. Before landfall, Michael's pressure fell so low it looked like the winds were sure to pick up fast, said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for weathermodels.com.\\n\\nAnd none of the factors that hold a storm back were present, especially something called \\\"wind shear.\\\" Wind shear is when there's a mismatch either in speed or direction between winds near the surface and those five to six miles (8 to 10 kilometers) up.\\n\\nThat mismatch \\\"pushes the storm over\\\" or decapitates it, Kossin said. When the wind shear near Michael eased, the storm took off, he said.\\n\\n\\\"It's kind of like someone was holding on to it when it was trying to run and they let it go,\\\" Kossin said.\\n\\nAnother huge factor was the water temperature. Warm water is the energy that fuels hurricanes, and the Gulf water is 4 to 5 degrees warmer than normal.\\n\\nWater temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico vary along with weather, but some scientists said the warm waters are signs of human-caused climate change.\\n\\n\\\"Have humans contributed to how dangerous Michael is?\\\" Kossin said. \\\"Now we can look at how warm the waters are and that certainly has contributed to how intense Michael is and its intensification.\\\"\\n\\nThe warm waters, Kossin said, are a \\\"human fingerprint\\\" of climate change.\\n\\nKossin and others have a study out this month in the Journal of Climate with computer simulations showing that human-caused global warming will increase rapid intensification of tropical weather across the globe in the future.\\n\\nOther studies have shown rapid intensification has already increased over past decades. One study this year in Geophysical Research Letters found that since 1986, the rate of intensification of storms like Michael has increased by about 13 mph.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

A phone call to Hussain's lawyer was not immediately returned.\\n\\nHussain was the day-to-day operator of Prestige Limousine, and the son of the company's owner.\\n\\nState police and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash, the nation's deadliest transportation accident since an air crash outside Buffalo in February 2009 killed 50 people.\\n\\nThe limousine ran off the road Saturday at the bottom of a long hill in Schoharie, 25 miles west of Albany. The crash killed two pedestrians and all 18 people in the limo celebrating a woman's birthday. The limo driver was among the dead.\\n\\nPrestige Limousine has been criticized for maintaining vehicles rife with violations and for employing a driver lacking a commercial license.\\n\\nPrestige's lawyer, Lee Kindlon, has said that safety issues were corrected. He said the driver might have misjudged his ability to stop at the bottom of a hill.\\n\\nThe driver's widow said her husband had expressed concerns about the company's vehicles.\\n\\nKim Lisinicchia told CBS in an interview broadcast on Wednesday that there were several times she heard her husband, Scott Lisinicchia, state: \\\"I'm not going to drive this, like this. You need to get me another car.\\\" But then \\\"he trusted in what the limo company said, that the cars were all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was in excellent health. He was an excellent driver. For over 20-plus years he drove a tractor-trailer,\\\" Kim Lisinicchia said.\\n\\n\\\"I feel for these victims,\\\" she said. \\\"I am in no way trying to make it seem like it's about me or my husband. I just want my husband to be vindicated. I have to stand for him, 'cause nobody else will.\\\"\\n\\nThe limousine that ran the stop sign was cited for code violations on Sept. 4, including a problem with the antilock brakes' malfunction indicator system. Four of the Gansevoort, New York-based company's limos were cited for 22 maintenance violations this year, though none was deemed critical.\\n\\n\\\"Those safety issues had been addressed and corrected,\\\" Kindlon told CBS News in a segment on Tuesday. \\\"Not all infractions are major. A lot of these things are minor and were fixed.\\\"\\n\\nState Department of Transportation spokesman Joseph Morrissey said a sticker was placed on the vehicle after the September inspection declaring it \\\"unserviceable.\\\" He said Kindlon's assertion that the code violations had been corrected and the vehicle cleared for service was \\\"categorically false.\\\"\\n\\nEven if the repairs were made, the limo would have needed to be re-inspected and the owner would need approval again to transport passengers, a state transportation department spokesman said.\\n\\nKindlon said he doesn't think those infractions contributed to the crash.\\n\\nA vigil for the victims will be held on Wednesday evening in a Schoharie school gymnasium.\\n\\nServices have been set for some of the victims, including 24-year-old Savannah Devonne Bursese, of Johnstown, the accident's youngest victim. Her family is holding a private service Friday. In nearby Amsterdam, a funeral Mass is scheduled Saturday for the four King sisters, three of their husbands and the brother of one of the husbands.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Albany, New York\"","lat":42,"lng":-73,"__v":0}

It's also increasing the number of students it trains to fly from 1,160 in 2017 to 1,311 in 2019 to 1,500 in 2022.\\n\\n\\\"The Air Force is more ready for major combat operations today than we were two years ago,\\\" Wilson told the House Armed Services Committee subpanel on readiness and management support in her prepared remarks. \\\"That said, we have a long way to go and we're after it.\\\"\\n\\nWilson made the comments to the Senate panel in the wake of challenging times for the Air Force. Like other services, it's faced a readiness crisis and a series of training crashes.\\n\\nIt's also been under pressure to address President Donald Trump's demand to create a new Space Force, which has drawn Wilson into the spotlight. Last week, media outlet Foreign Policy reported Trump might oust Wilson over delays to support a new military service branch.\\n\\nAt the start of Wednesday's hearing, new subpanel chairman Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said Space Force wouldn't be a topic of discussion on Air Force readiness.\\n\\n\\\"I commend President Trump for thinking about space in a more assertive and organized way,\\\" Sullivan said. But first, \\\"we must focus on the readiness of the existing military services, which I think everyone recognizes has plummeted over the last several years so that they are fully ready do what the president and the American people expect of them.\\\"\\n\\nThe military has received a boost in funds in the last two years to address a readiness crisis that has gripped all the services. Last month, funding was approved for the $716 billion 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which was passed into law in time for the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.\\n\\nYet challenges going forward remain, said John Pendleton, an official for the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency that has conducted several studies on Air Force readiness concerns.\\n\\n\\\"Over the past quarter century, we have been tracking readiness and we have seen it gradually but steadily decline. Primarily because the Air Force has gotten smaller, but demand has stayed high,\\\" said Pendleton, GAO director of defense capabilities and management. Now, \\\"the Air Force is aiming to have 80 percent of its over 300 operational squadrons ready within about 5 years. It's is an aggressive goal.\\\"\\n\\nIn 2016, the agency urged the Defense Department to develop a plan for readiness rebuilding. At that time, the Air Force suggested it could take 10 years with increased budgets and decreased pace of operations. But while budgets have increased, the pace has remained high, he said.\\n\\n\\\"Regardless of future growth, the Air Force will have to keep much of its existing force structure for decades to come... the priority needs to be rebuilding the readiness of the existing fleet,\\\" Pendleton said. The Air Force has \\\"taken several steps in the right direction. Now it's a matter of achieving results. Recovery won't be easy or fast. It took a quarter century for the Air Force to get here, so it may take a while to recover.\\\"\\n\\nSullivan raised concerns on why there is such a disparity between commercial and military aircraft readiness. For example, Delta Air Lines' readiness for their fleet is at 86 percent, while the F-35 is about 65 percent, Sullivan said.\\n\\n\\\"Why is there such a disparity between military aircraft that are brand new and commercial aircraft,\\\" the senator asked. \\\"I know it's a complex aircraft ...but it does seem to me kind of ludicrous that we get new aircraft off the production line and, you know, within a month they're at 65 percent readiness.\\\"\\n\\nWilson told Sullivan that the boost in readiness goals is part of addressing these concerns.\\n\\nPendleton, however, said when it comes to the F-35, there hasn't been enough focus within the Air Force on sustaining the aircraft, instead of focusing on production.\\n\\n\\\"It's causing problems now,\\\" he said. \\\"And it's going to be difficult to achieve those kinds of mission capability rates.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

Duhart caught eight passes for 100 yards, while Fulgham had a career-high 10 receptions for 151 yards and a touchdown.\\n\\nThe Monarchs' running game is also improving, as junior Kesean Strong set career highs against FAU with 21 carries and 99 yards on the way to three rushing touchdowns and a scoring reception.\\n\\nAlthough the Herd has lost twice and enters this one off its first setback in league play. Wilder isn't expecting Marshall to look much different than what he's seen from them before.\\n\\n\\\"They're consistently a very good program and have been since we joined C-USA.\\\" Wilder said. \\\"Offensively they are going for 380 yards a game, 26 points.

Thomson replaced injured Herd signal caller Isaiah Green.\\n\\n\\\"I thought I saw him get more comfortable throughout the (Middle Tennessee) game,\\\" Holliday said. \\\"I don't think there is any question that getting a game under his belt might help and I thought he got better throughout the game and he will be better this week.\\\"\\n\\nWilder hopes the usual boisterous crowd at tiny Foreman Field (capacity 20,118) will give his struggling club a boost as it spends four of the final six games of the season in the Tidewater area.\\n\\n\\\"It just feels like we've been on the road all year,\\\" Wilder said. \\\"We played very well at home so I'm excited about that.\\n\\n\\\"We're frustrated right now to be 1-5, especially when that one win is over a nationally-ranked Virginia Tech team. We know our record should be better at this point, so we're going to turn the page start the second half of the season with a goal to have an outstanding second half of the season.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Huntington, West Virginia\"","lat":38,"lng":-82,"__v":0}

Their version of grit 'n grind that got them to seven straight playoff berths might not work with this current roster.\\n\\nBut Memphis still has guard Mike Conley and center Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies know who they are and that they need to play defense to be competitive in the loaded Western Conference.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to be a contrarian team, and we've had a lot of success here over the years in this grit-grind era of being a contrarian team,\\\" Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said.\\n\\nMost of the Grizzlies' confidence stems from having Conley back from a heel injury that limited him to 12 games last season , and Conley averaged 17.1 points per game in his short stint. Gasol remains one of the NBA's top centers, and he and Conley are the NBA's longest-tenured teammates without any interruption.\\n\\nMemphis revamped the roster in the offseason, swapping some youth for more experienced players. The miserable 22-60 season at least netted the Grizzlies the No. 4 overall pick on forward Jaren Jackson Jr. of Michigan State.\\n\\n\\\"It's good as long as they have the mindset of winning and improving and the growth mindset,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"I think the young guys bring a breath of fresh air, a new swag, they call it.\\\"\\n\\nSome other things to know about the Grizzlies who open this season Oct. 17 at Indiana:\\n\\nGASOL'S FUTURE\\n\\nThe 7-foot-1 center, who turns 34 in January, can opt out of his contract next summer holding a $25 million player option. Gasol has started 709 of the 716 games he's played for the Grizzlies, and this will be the 11th season for a three-time All-Star who has yet to play in the NBA Finals. The closest Gasol and Memphis came was the 2013 Western Finals before being swept by San Antonio.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot promise you anything, or what the future is,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"What I can tell you is how much I'm going to put in this season and how much I care about the success of the team.\\\"\\n\\nANOTHER NEW COACH\\n\\nJ.B. Bickerstaff has plenty of experience taking over as interim coach first in Houston and last season with the Grizzlies when David Fizdale was fired in late November. The Grizzlies gave him the job in May, and Bickerstaff had an entire offseason to pick his own assistants and plan for the season.\\n\\nHEALTHY PARSONS\\n\\nForward Chandler Parsons played 34 games in his first season with Memphis, and he managed 36 games last season for the Grizzlies. He averaged 7.9 points per game and shot a career-high 42.1 percent from 3-point range. The Grizzlies need more, and Parsons, who signed a four-year, $94 million contract with Memphis in 2016 , believes his knee issues are past him after playing with no limitations this summer.\\n\\n\\\"Let's face it the last two years have gone horribly and not the way I planned, but the reasons why I came to Memphis are still all intact and with J.B. as the coach and still able to play with Mike and Marc and the fan base we have here is the reason I came here,\\\" Parsons said. \\\"And they're all three still in play.\\\"\\n\\nTRIPLE-J\\n\\nThe Grizzlies have whiffed on many draft picks during their tenure in Memphis. Conley, the fourth overall pick in 2007, is the rare first-round selection who has thrived. The Grizzlies need Jackson, the Big Ten defensive player of the year last season, to live up to the promise shown in his summer league debut, and the 19-year-old forward understands the expectations he faces. He said he embraces the pressure to prove himself. \\\"You feel it inside you,\\\" Jackson said. \\\"You just got to show everybody else.\\\"\\n\\nNEW SUPPORTING CAST\\n\\nThe Grizzlies signed Kyle Anderson, who started 67 games last season for San Antonio, with being ready to take a big step forward after signing him to a three-year, $37.2 million offer sheet. They traded away Ben McLemore and Deyonta Davis to Sacramento for Garrett Temple, who set career-highs last season for both points per game and 3-point percentage. Omri Casspi shot 58 percent overall and 45.5 percent beyond the arc for Golden State last season, while Shelvin Mack averaged a career-high 4.9 assists last season with Orlando. They also drafted Jevon Carter, who won both Big 12 defensive player of the year and the new Naismith defensive player of the year award.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Memphis, Tennessee\"","lat":35,"lng":-90,"__v":0}

(AP) -- Locked in a tight race with Democrat Tony Evers, Republican Gov. Scott Walker looked to Vice President Mike Pence to give him a boost on Wednesday with the election less than a month away.\\n\\nPence's two closed-door fundraisers for Walker, in Green Bay and Eau Claire, came on the same day that a new Marquette University Law School poll showed the governor's race to be about even.\\n\\nThe survey, conducted Oct. 3 through Sunday, showed voter attitudes in Wisconsin for the first time since the culmination of the nomination fight over U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\\n\\nKavanaugh won confirmation on Saturday, just over a week after a Senate hearing that captivated the nation. Kavanaugh strongly denied allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school decades ago.\\n\\nDemocratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin voted against Kavanaugh's confirmation, while her Republican opponent Leah Vukmir was a vocal supporter . The poll showed Baldwin's lead over Vukmir to be nearly unchanged from September, at 53 percent to 43 percent.\\n\\nWalker tried to distance himself from the debate while saying he thought Kavanaugh was qualified to serve on the court. Evers, meanwhile, said he believed Ford's accusations and that Kavanaugh should not have been confirmed.\\n\\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have tried to use that confirmation fight to their advantage in the Nov. 6 election. The last Marquette poll , done in September just before Ford's accusation against Kavanaugh became public, showed that Democrats were more motivated than Republicans to vote in Wisconsin. That helped to give Evers a 5-point advantage over Walker, which the latest poll showed Walker had made up.\\n\\nThe new poll had Walker at 47 percent with Evers at 46 percent.\\n\\nThe survey of 799 likely voters was conducted Oct. 3 through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\\n\\nWalker has cast himself as the underdog in the race and urged his supporters to believe the polls.\\n\\nEvers used the Pence visit on Monday to hit on one of the central themes of his campaign -- health care. He released a video renewing his challenge for Walker to drop Wisconsin from a multi-state lawsuit seeking to repeal the national health care law. Evers argued in the video that repealing the Affordable Care Act would \\\"gut\\\" insurance protections because it would do away with the guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\\n\\nWalker supports passing a state law that would guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\\n\\nPolls have consistently shown health care to be one of the highest priority issues for Wisconsin voters this year.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\\n\\n___\\n\\nSign up for \\\"Politics in Focus,\\\" a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP's best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Madison, Wisconsin\"","lat":43,"lng":-89,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de356627a"},"title":"\"Market forces put America's recycling industry in the dumps\"","body":"\"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- America's recycling industry is in the dumps.\\n\\nA crash in the global market for recyclables is forcing communities to make hard choices about whether they can afford to keep recycling or should simply send all those bottles, cans and plastic containers to the landfill.\\n\\nMountains of paper have piled up at sorting centers, worthless. Cities and towns that once made money on recyclables are instead paying high fees to processing plants to take them. Some financially strapped recycling processors have shut down entirely, leaving municipalities with no choice but to dump or incinerate their recyclables.\\n\\n\\\"There's no market. We're paying to get rid of it,\\\" says Ben Harvey, president of EL Harvey \u0026 Sons, which handles recyclables from about 30 communities at its sorting facility in Westborough, Massachusetts. \\\"Seventy-five percent of what goes through our plant is worth nothing to negative numbers now.\\\"\\n\\nIt all stems from a policy shift by China, long the world's leading recyclables buyer. At the beginning of the year it enacted an anti-pollution program that closed its doors to loads of waste paper, metals or plastic unless they're 99.5 percent pure. That's an unattainable standard at U.S. single-stream recycling processing plants designed to churn out bales of paper or plastic that are, at best, 97 percent free of contaminants such as foam cups and food waste.\\n\\nThe resulting glut of recyclables has caused prices to plummet from levels already depressed by other economic forces, including lower prices for oil, a key ingredient in plastics.\\n\\nThe three largest publicly traded residential waste-hauling and recycling companies in North America -- Waste Management, Republic Services and Waste Connections -- reported steep drops in recycling revenues in their second-quarter financial results. Houston-based Waste Management reported its average price for recyclables was down 43 percent from the previous year.\\n\\n\\\"A year ago, a bale of mixed paper was worth about $100 per ton; today we have to pay about $15 to get rid of it,\\\" says Richard Coupland, vice president for municipal sales at Phoenix-based Republic, which handles 75 million tons of municipal solid waste and 8 million tons of recyclables nationwide annually. \\\"Smaller recycling companies aren't able to stay in business and are shutting down.\\\"\\n\\nKirkwood, Missouri, announced plans this summer to end curbside recycling after a St. Louis-area processing facility shut down. Officials in Rock Hill, South Carolina, were surprised to learn that recyclables collected at curbside were being dumped because of a lack of markets. Lack of markets led officials to suspend recycling programs in Gouldsboro, Maine; DeBary, Florida; Franklin, New Hampshire; and Adrian Township, Michigan. Programs have been scaled back in Flagstaff, Arizona; La Crosse, Wisconsin; and Kankakee, Illinois.\\n\\nOther communities are maintaining recycling programs but taking a financial hit as regional processors have raised rates to offset losses. Richland, Washington, is now paying $122 a ton for Waste Management to take its recycling; last year, the city was paid $16 a ton for the materials. Stamford, Connecticut, received $95,000 for recyclables last year; the city's new contract requires it to pay $700,000.\\n\\nA big part of the problem, besides lower commodity prices overall, is sloppy recycling.\\n\\nIn the early days of recycling, people had to wash bottles and cans, and sort paper, plastic, glass and metal into separate bins. Now there's single-stream recycling, which allows all recyclables to be tossed into one bin. While single-stream has benefited efficiency, and customers like it, it's been a challenge on the contamination side.\\n\\nA tour of Republic's facility in Beacon, about an hour's drive north of New York City, makes the challenges clear. A third of the material dumped by collection trucks is non-recyclable \\\"contaminants\\\" such as garden hoses, picnic coolers and broken lawnmowers. Workers have to pull that out and truck it to a landfill, adding to overall costs. Plastic bags contaminate bales of other materials and tangle machinery. Spilled ketchup and greasy pizza boxes turn otherwise marketable material into garbage.\\n\\n\\\"The death of recycling was completely avoidable and incredibly easily fixed,\\\" says Mitch Hedlund, executive director of Recycle Across America, which advocates standardized labeling on recycling bins so people understand what goes in and what doesn't.\\n\\nA range of initiatives have been launched to get people to recycle right. Chicago is putting \\\"oops\\\" tags on curbside recycling bins with improper contents and leaving them uncollected. Rhode Island is airing \\\"Let's Recycle Right\\\" ads.\\n\\nWhile some recyclables have been diverted to other Asian markets since China's closure, there are also signs of market improvement in the U.S. to offset the lost business, said David Biderman, CEO and executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America. He noted Chinese paper manufacturers that had relied on recyclables imported into their country have recently purchased shuttered mills in Kentucky, Maine and Wisconsin.\\n\\nMeanwhile, recyclable materials processors are re-negotiating contracts with municipalities to reflect the fact that prices paid for recyclables no longer offset the cost of collecting and sorting them.\\n\\n\\\"What we're advocating is to step back and re-look at recycling,\\\" Republic's Coupland said. \\\"This is the new normal. The model no longer funds itself.\\\"\\n\\n-- -- --\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon, contributed to this report.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Albany, New York\"","lat":42,"lng":-73,"__v":0}

Stamp Student Union Atrium with mock-ups and a lengthy map illustrating the path of the system along with representatives eager to discuss its progress.\\n\\nEasels held renderings of the stops near the area, plus an outline of the full connection overlaid on the Metro map.\\n\\nThe 16-mile light rail will have 21 stations from Bethesda to New Carrollton, with links to the Red, Orange and Green Metro lines. The Purple Line will operate mainly on roadways, in dedicated lanes or in mixed traffic, according to Purple Line Transit Partners documentation.\\n\\nConstruction began on the project last August but was delayed by a lawsuit regarding Metro ridership until a little over a month ago, even though the case was dismissed in December 2017.\\n\\nDespite the time off, Purple Line officials are still aiming for completion in 2022, though in the fall instead of the original spring target.\\n\\n\\\"We're still planning on carrying our first passengers in fall of 2022,\\\" said Purple Line Transit Partners Communications Director John Undeland. \\\"The next four years are gonna be a lot more active than this first year.\\\"\\n\\nPrince George's County residents have not been affected by construction so far, as most of the work has been done in Montgomery County up to this point, but shovels hit the dirt at UMD about a month ago.\\n\\nOne lane of Campus Drive, which virtually splits the campus down the middle stretching from Route 1 to Adelphi Road, was closed to make room for work to take place on the project. Students, faculty and residents should get used to this situation.\\n\\n\\\"We've got construction in a lot of different locations and it's just going to intensify,\\\" Undeland said. \\\"Our message to the public is to get ready. This is going to have impacts, and you are going to run into lane closures, there's going to be inconveniences, there will be more orange barrels out there, just be ready for it.\\\"\\n\\nSeveral factors have contributed to the plodding progression of the project, said Undeland, from narrow spaces to wildlife and forestry restrictions. The director likened building the Purple Line to replacing floorboards during a house party, working on one side while pushing everyone to the other, and then vice versa.\\n\\nThe overhead power system necessitates the removal of plant life for safety reasons, which will mean cutting down around 42 acres of trees along the corridor. P.G. County will receive 43 acres of trees to mitigate the impact, but only about 13 acres along the alignment. The tree removal was delayed by migratory bird restrictions that prohibited the action from April through August, a further hindrance to the process.\\n\\nThe open house drew a few residents, but the most common attendees were UMD students in fields relating to the project. There were a handful of architecture students along with a broad swath of future community planners, who peppered Purple Line staff with queries about every inch of the project.\\n\\n\\\"The graphics are nice. However you can tell two different people did the graphic versus the map,\\\" noted Elena G., a graduate student in Community Planning who declined to give her full last name. \\\"The maps are actually upside down compared to the pictures.\\\"\\n\\nElena's class is studying the Takoma-Langley Purple Line stop, specifically the effect it will have on minority-owned businesses in the area. Purple Line officials are prepared to provide signage for local businesses that may be affected by construction, along with coupons to workers for use at those establishments, but the planning group wasn't sure that would be enough. Elena mentioned grant money was given to businesses in Montgomery County, though not in P.G. at this time.\\n\\nLan Tsubata Lee is vice president of the West Lanham Hills Citizens' Association, where residents are divided about the project.\\n\\nShe explained the neighborhood has been around since 1939 and still has some of its original residents, who aren't exactly thrilled about such a significant change in the area.

If he keeps doing that, that will give us a chance.\\\"\\n\\nLittleton had the breakout game Roosevelt has been waiting for as he rushed for 130 yards on 18 carries and scored two touchdowns.\\n\\nCombined with a three-interception performance by the defense, the Raiders muscled their way to their third straight victory, defeating DuVal High School 34-0 on Oct. 5.\\n\\nWith Littleton, a transfer from St. John's College High School, carrying the bulk of the running game, Roosevelt (4-1) was able to bounce back from an early interception by Tigers' senior defensive back Robert Curtis to get their offense moving.\\n\\nRunning like previous players from Roosevelt's past teams,' the sophomore trucked his way off two DuVal tacklers to finish off a 36-yard touchdown run.\\n\\nSeven Raiders rushed for a combined 206 yards on-the-ground, keeping the offense on the field and converted for first downs with force. Quarterback Jalen Walters, who rushed for 33 yards, snuck in a 1-yard touchdown on fourth-and-goal to give Roosevelt a two-score lead.\\n\\nMeanwhile, DuVal (4-2) could not establish a rhythm offensively thanks to Roosevelt's defense.\\n\\nThe defensive line sacked quarterback Akil Woods Jr. four times and limited his passing game to four receptions for 64 yards.\\n\\nEarly in the second quarter, Woods' attempted screen pass was intercepted by a sliding Makail Jackson, setting up Littleton's second touchdown for the Raiders.\\n\\n\\\"We couldn't get a groove going, and it killed us,\\\" Tigers Head Coach Carlos Lockwood said. \\\"We went down early, and our guys need to keep fighting. It's another learning experience, but we will bounce back but have to learn to close out (drives).\\\"\\n\\nThe Tigers came out at halftime, poised to score on their opening drive. However, those hopes were nullified by senior Canaan Holmes' 80-yard interception return for Roosevelt's fourth touchdown.\\n\\n\\\"We really prepared during the week, studying film on DuVal and went to work today,\\\" Holmes said. \\\"We really work hard in practice and bring intensity every day in practice like it was an in-game situation so we can go get after it.\\\"\\n\\nDuVal continued to try to move their offense forward through running back DeMaj Smith, leaving him in one drive as the team's de facto quarterback to use his speed to obtain first downs.\\n\\nHowever, the pressure created by the defensive line, powered by seniors James Ballanger and Adrian Lewis, cut through DuVal's protection and harassed Woods and Smith all night long.\\n\\nWith less than two minutes to go and the game out of reach, Walters provided a parting shot to the visitors, striking a missile pass to senior wide receiver Chris Billings for a 21-yard touchdown. After the final score, both teams exchanged words, forcing coaches to monitor their players during the post-game handshakes.\\n\\n\\\"It's not really trash talk, and it's more of seeing your friend that you played with middle school, but now, you go to different high schools; its chippy but I like it,\\\" Lockwood said.\\n\\n\\\"But we would never let it get out of hand, and people need to understand that we never let it get out of hand with these guys. We will keep it between the lines but just need to do a better job at facing adversity.\\\"\\n\\nThe win provided Green a sense of relief as Roosevelt looks to obtain a state playoff spot through a nine-game schedule.\\n\\nOpponents like Dr. Henry Wise, Potomac and Oxon Hill will not make the journey easier but if the offense continues to trend upwards, the Raiders hope to be a threat this postseason, Green said.\\n\\n\\\"If we improve our passing game a little more, then we will be a deadly team,\\\" Littleton said. \\\"If we do that, state's will be there for us.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Greenbelt, Maryland\"","lat":39,"lng":-76,"__v":0}

With 6.6 megawatts, it will have enough energy to power 800 homes. Because it is community solar, it will market to the general public in the Pepco service territory.\\n\\n\\\"One of the things we're always trying to do is trying to find property that's large enough to be able to locate a system and doesn't have other higher use,\\\" said CEO Jim Rice.\\n\\nNautilus Solar Energy, based in New Jersey, is a national solar acquisition, development and asset management company and was founded in 2006. Their focus is on acquiring, developing, executing and managing distributed and utility-scale generation solar projects and over the last 10 years the company has invested in hundreds of megawatts of solar projects and provides asset management services to distributed, community solar and utility projects throughout North America.\\n\\nThey acquired the project from co-developers Summit Ridge Energy LLC and SynerGen LLC, both developers and financiers of community solar power plants across the United States.\\n\\n\\\"We were thrilled to work with our co-development partner Summit Ridge Energy on this landmark community solar portfolio on a unique brownfield site,\\\" said SynerGen Solar LLC CEO Hillel Halberstam. \\\"The portfolio reclaims an otherwise unusable landfill site, utilizing it for the benefit of the county and its residents, as well as all other Pepco ratepayers in Maryland.\\\"\\n\\nThe process of creating the community solar project began in early 2017 around the time of establishment of Maryland's Community Solar Pilot Program.\\n\\n\\\"It started because there was legislation in 2015 and then the commission had to establish regulations and then utilities now have interconnection cues,\\\" said Tori Leonard, communications director for the Maryland Public Service Commission. \\\"The regulations were adopted two years ago.\\\"\\n\\nThe program will allow customers to save money on their electric bills, encourage private investment in Maryland's solar industry, diversify the state's energy resources to meet the Renewable Portfolio Standard and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act goals as well as allow Marylanders to benefit from more clean energy options.\\n\\n\\\"The goal is to sort of open solar energy for communities that might not otherwise have access to it like people who rent or live in apartment buildings,\\\" Leonard said. \\\"It is a three-year pilot program.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to Rice, community solar benefits the community in a number of ways, one of them having to do with money. It not only allows customers to save money on their utility bills but will enable people of all income levels, not just the upper class, to be able to use it.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's important anytime you're talking about these systems is that over the program there will be an allocation to low to medium income,\\\" he said. \\\"One of the things about solar is that you often hear the higher income folks are the only ones who can do it with more expensive houses. Community solar, the general assembly legislature, has done a good job of designing a system that promotes low and middle income.\\\"\\n\\nOn top of the monetary aspect, community solar lends itself to the broader community as far as its use. It doesn't require people to put solar panels on their houses, and those who rent or live in apartments can benefit from it. Community solar also gives new life to unused land and doesn't disrupt other property such as farmland and creates jobs for the county.\\n\\nPrince George's County was chosen for the community solar project because of the available use of land and the availability of customers in the Pepco service territory to allow customers to use the panel.\\n\\nAdditionally, Maryland has been a leader in solar energy, Rice said. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Maryland has about one vehicle lot total of solar installed, which is number 13 in the country.\\n\\nThe Maryland General Assembly has the Community Solar Pilot Program split into phases over the next two or three years in the hopes of building more systems, Rice said. Over the next few years, Nautilus will be building more projects around the state and will soon be announcing systems in Howard County and in Baltimore County in White Marsh.\\n\\n\\\"I think that we, Nautilus Solar, have a commitment as far as that side as well so over our fitting into the context in Maryland I think that's a part of the program that we'll all see continue to grow and that's important as far as they broader opportunity to take advantage of solar and take advantage of the savings,\\\" said Rice. \\\"That's one of the important factors in community solar growth both in Prince George's County and more broadly.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

Larry Hogan in a press release. \\\"These awards will support important projects that encourage neighborhood improvement and positive economic growth.\\\"\\n\\nThe funds come from the Division of Neighborhood Revitalization which hosts an annual application for state revitalization programs. These include the Baltimore Regional Neighborhood Initiative, National Capital Strategic Economic Development Fund, Community Legacy and Strategic Demolition Fund.\\n\\n\\\"While each program has its own distinctive features and eligibility, the overall aim is to provide financial assistance in the form of grants or loans to eligible entities who apply for particular capital projects to advance local and community neighborhood revitalization goals,\\\" said Communications Manager Sara Luell.\\n\\nFunds were awarded throughout the state, mainly in Baltimore City and County for various housing and neighborhood developments, as well as Anne Arundel County, Montgomery County and Prince George's County.\\n\\n\\\"Each application is reviewed during a comprehensive review process utilizing an intra-agency review team of state agencies,\\\" Luell said. \\\"Site visits are performed during this time.\\n\\n\\\"Applications are evaluated on a series of factors, including the demonstration of community need for reinvestment, revitalization impact, readiness to proceed, project financing/committed financial resources to complete the project and capacity of project sponsors and partners.\\\"\\n\\nPrince George's County received money for three different projects.\\n\\nOne of them will award $200,000 to Housing Initiative Partnership, Inc. to go toward the revitalization of Palmer Park Meadows Townhomes.\\n\\nThe City of Hyattsville received $250,000 to work with urban investment partners on the redevelopment of Baltimore Avenue.\\n\\nFor this project, the property that is immediately south of the Hyattsville Armory Building will be redone and the property south of that down to Hamilton Street is scheduled to be raised and removed from the site.\\n\\n\\\"The redevelopment of that block it is largely filled with underutilized buildings,\\\" said Hyattsville Director of Community and Economic Development Jim Chandler. \\\"I think it's safe to say over the past decade, and it has been a candidate for redevelopment.\\\"\\n\\nWhat took so long for the project to get off the ground, Chandler said, was that several different owners owned the properties and so their urban investment partner has spent the nearly two years acquiring the individual properties to consolidate them. The consolidation has been completed in the past six months, and they are currently preparing a development application that should be finished being reviewed by the Park and Planning Commission sometime in November.\\n\\nThe town plans to apply for grants in the future to work on other projects. Usually, their objective is to look at opportunities for adaptive reuse of buildings, generally for small businesses and nonprofits.\\n\\n\\\"So when you look at spaces like Pyramid Atlantic Art Center or Art Works Now or Vigilante Coffee, we found a very good niche for thriving businesses and nonprofits to utilize space,\\\" Chandler said.\\n\\n\\\"There are, however, times where the buildings or the block are just not functional and in those instances, redevelopment is often a better way forward to achieve a higher and better land use.\\\"\\n\\nThe last award for Prince George's County went to Town of Capitol Heights who received $100,000. This funding will go toward the demolition of four houses that were abandoned during the foreclosure crisis. They will either add green space to the area or redevelop it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the town didn't receive enough money for this and other projects they had planned for when applying for the grant.\\n\\n\\\"This $100,000 will certainly help us in that process but we won't be able to do what we intended to do based on the amount we had received,\\\" said Town Administrator Jason Small.\\n\\nAccording to Small, the town has been active in seeking grants and resources for their plans to reimagine Capitol Heights regarding development and quality of life for its residents.\\n\\n\\\"What I hope, and what I think everybody here in the staff and mayor and council are hoping for, is a situation where people that are here who are aging in place can live with dignity at the same time as we see a revitalization in the family and structures that will support a diverse community development,\\\" Small said. \\\"Everyone from seniors to growing families to new millennials can live and contribute to a robust town culture.\\\"\\n\\nThe town is working toward not only a shift in resources to the inner beltway communities that will reflect their importance geographically but also to change the narrative of Capitol Heights as a whole.\\n\\nThat means adding more transit-oriented development, quality housing for residents and providing new economic opportunities for the area to grow Capitol Heights with the rest of the county moving forward.\\n\\n\\\"The time has come to deal with the cultural impacts that being known as Capitol Heights in one way for a long time because we've worked pretty hard to eliminate that reputation internally but it hasn't creeped out externally in the way that we would like,\\\" Small said. \\\"So we're hoping that the hard work we're trying to do and the vision we're trying to implement will see some fruition, funding and otherwise.\\\"\\n\\nThe Department of Housing and Community Development takes applications for these kinds of grants every year and gives out funds to as many applicants as possible. Although funds are limited, there is the potential for more work to be done around Prince George's County as needed.\\n\\n\\\"We have annual application rounds for our state revitalization projects, and demand regularly outweighs the funds available to award,\\\" Luell said. \\\"We expect to continue to receive interest in funding community development projects across the state through our various programs.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Capitol Heights, Maryland\"","lat":38,"lng":-76,"__v":0}

We really want the government to represent us.\\\"\\n\\nThe fair elections bill will allow candidates to run for county executive, county council at-large and district offices by collecting contributions from residents and receiving funds from the county based on how much support they have from the community.\\n\\nThe system, which is voluntary, will essentially allow candidates to run for office free of big money and ensure that elected officials are held accountable to their constituents instead of wealthy special interests.\\n\\nThe candidates must raise a certain amount of money from the community to be matched by the county. They can take no more than $250 from each person, and after reaching the threshold for their position, they get money from the county based on how much they raised depending on what position they are running for.\\n\\nThey cannot take money from special interest groups like corporations or PACs.\\n\\nEach candidate must raise a specific amount from a number of community contributions to show that they are a viable candidate before the county matches their funds. Those running for county executive can take up to 500 contributions and $40,000, for at-large council members they can take 250 contributions and $15,000 and for district council they can have 150 donations and $7,500. At the end of the general election, the money that is not used will go back to the county.\\n\\n\\\"You can talk to candidates, and they can tell you it's a lot of time to go and raise the money,\\\" Balachandran said. \\\"While they're raising the money, they are talking to different people, they are not talking to us, and they are spending time that they should much rather be spending talking to different people in the county.\\\"\\n\\nOur Revolution Prince George's is part of the Fair Elections Maryland Coalition which was founded to establish small donor campaign finance programs for local and state elections. The coalition includes over 45 labor, social justice, good government and environmental organizations across the state.\\n\\nTen members of the Prince George's County chapter came together on the third day of the month to discuss the bill and the legislation up to this point, what comes next and their strategies to gain more support.\\n\\n\\\"There is a real through line,\\\" said Our Revolution member John Spillane. \\\"We likely see this affecting the way policy is actually decided because, think about it, if you have a table of all the people commenting you have five large developers and 150 people from nurses to bus drivers, what those two different groups want effects how legislation is made. You get two different outcomes. That's our goal, to make it more democratic.\\\"\\n\\nThe bill first came before the county council in 2017 and there have been two other briefings since then. It is now up for public hearing on Oct. 23, the last day of the council session, where it will be voted on. If the bill is passed, it will take effect for the next county election in 2022.\\n\\nIn 2014, Montgomery County became the first county in the state to establish the matching program.\\n\\nAccording to Balachandran, the county executive and three out of the four at-large council seats used the matching program which is spreading across the state. Howard County established the program in 2017 to be used during the 2022 election, and Baltimore City is awaiting a referendum in the November election before they establish the program. In Washington, D.C., the council recently voted to use the program as well.\\n\\nOur Revolution Prince George's has been spreading awareness for the bill around the county and have gotten people to sign petitions to let the county council know that they want the bill passed, said Balachandran.\\n\\nThey have had experts on the issue such as the Director of Campaign Finance from the State Board of Elections, who managed the Montgomery County Program. Staff members from the Brennan Center for Justice - Democracy Program, staff members from good government advocacy groups and Pastor Delman Coates who ran for Lt. Governor in 2014 with public financing advocate for them at county council hearings and they have also gotten the support from several council members and from County Executive Rushern Baker, III.\\n\\n\\\"I'm a veteran of debate on public policy, and I've seen the corrosive interests where elections are bought by individuals and corporations,\\\" said Our Revolution member Greg Smith. \\\"It has a really damaging impact on the electoral process and people's faith in the electoral process.

It was emotional and a moment that hockey fans in this area waited for since the team began playing in the fall of 1974.\\n\\nThe Caps had gotten their championship rings earlier in the week and started the season the night the banner was raised with a stunning 7-0 victory over the Boston Bruins. Washington got two goals in the first two minutes, one from T.J.

I believe it.\\\"\\n\\nThe offense answered again the next night but the defense couldn't and gave up a power-play goal that gave the Pittsburgh Penguins a 7-6 victory over the Caps on the road.

Brees broke the record with a 62-yard touchdown pass to Tre'Quan Smith.\\n\\nWashington's falling into a deep hole made it too tough for the Alex Smith-led offense to get back into it. Smith threw for 275 yards but the Redskins ran for only 39 yards.\\n\\nThe Saints took a 26-13 halftime lead and rolled from there.\\n\\n\\\"I think we got behind early, and we have [not] been a very good team when we get behind, for whatever reason,\\\" Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said in post-game press conference. \\\"It was just a total team [poor performance], and I'm the one in charge of it, and I take responsibility for it.\\\"\\n\\nDwight Howard's status took another bad turn earlier this week when the center, who has yet to play in the pre-season games, went back to Washington for a shot to help his back, according to various media reports.\\n\\nThe Washington Post reported that Howard felt some soreness in his already-tender back Sunday after a workout (light) the day before.\\n\\n\\\"He's going to get a pain-relieving injection and hopefully early next week, he'll be back on the court and be ready to play,\\\" Washington coach Scott Brooks told The Post Monday. \\\"I don't what that means for the first game, but we're just gonna take it day by day.\\\"\\n\\nThe Wizards play two more exhibition games, on Oct. 10 (at Detroit) and Oct 12 versus the Guangzhou Long-Lions from the Chinese Basketball Association. After that, the season opener on Oct. 18 in Washington versus the Miami Heat.\\n\\nThe Howard situation is one that everyone will keep their eyes on. It is appearing more likely that he'll miss the opener.\\n\\nD.C. UNITED FIGHTS FOR PLAYOFF SPOT\\n\\nAs the season winds down, D.C. United has pushed itself right back into the battle for a playoff spot.\\n\\nD.C. United will host FC Dallas at Audi Field on Oct. 13, another game the hosts need if they want that post-season spot.

CVS could offer more preventive care services and screenings in its clinics, such as enabling patients with diabetes to monitor blood sugar levels, avoiding higher cost visits to doctors or emergency rooms.\\n\\nCVS aims to cut costs by $750 million annually by the end of the second year after the deal closes.\\n\\nIt is the second large recent healthcare deal to win U.S. Justice Department approval. The agency gave the green light to health insurer Cigna Corp's $52 billion acquisition of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), Express Scripts Holding Co, on Sept. 17.\\n\\nShares of CVS and Aetna each rose about 1 percent on Wednesday, a day when the broader market was sharply lower, with CVS trading at $80.20 and Aetna at $206.48.\\n\\nThe deal was approved on the condition that the companies sell Aetna's standalone Medicare prescription drug plan business, known as Medicare Part D, the Justice department said.\\n\\nAetna last month said it would sell all of those standalone plans for prescription drugs that are part of the Medicare program for Americans aged 65 and older and the disabled to WellCare Health Plans Inc, paving the way for the deal's approval.\\n\\nWithout the sale the two companies would have owned more than a 30 percent share of those standalone Medicare drug plans, creating concern about the amount of control the new CVS would have had over this part of the Medicare insurance market. Drugs administered by doctors and hospitals are covered under a separate Medicare benefit.\\n\\nTogether Aetna and CVS have 6.8 million members in standalone Medicare drug plans, the Justice Department said. CVS also has a large PBM business.\\n\\n\\\"The divestitures required here allow for the creation of an integrated pharmacy and health benefits company that has the potential to generate benefits by improving the quality and lowering the costs of the healthcare services that American consumers can obtain,\\\" Makan Delrahim, head of the department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement.\\n\\nON TRACK TO CLOSE THIS YEAR\\n\\nCalifornia, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington also joined the antitrust review.\\n\\n\\\"We know that over consolidation is bad for healthcare and leaves millions of Californians with fewer options. We will keep close watch to ensure that the terms of this settlement are met,\\\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.\\n\\nCVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement that the deal is on track to close early in the fourth quarter. CVS first announced plans to buy Aetna last December.\\n\\nSince then, online retailer Amazon.com Inc stepped into the healthcare market with the purchase of online pharmacy PillPack, which Wall Street analysts say can help it expand further in healthcare and undercut major players across the prescription drugs supply chain.\\n\\nAmazon has also aligned itself with JP Morgan Chase \u0026 Co and Berkshire Hathaway Inc to experiment with new models for employee healthcare - one of Aetna's target markets for health insurance.\\n\\nThe decision comes as the Trump administration intensifies pressure on healthcare industry \\\"middlemen,\\\" such as PBMs, over practices it says increase the cost of prescription medicines for U.S. consumers.\\n\\nAfter the deals were announced, antitrust experts described them as \\\"vertical\\\" combinations that were less troublesome from a competitive standpoint than a previous round of proposed consolidation deals among insurers, which were blocked.\\n\\nThe Justice Department sued and won its case to stop Aetna's $37 billion plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurer Humana Inc.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de356629c"},"title":"\"Edward Snowden to Address Audience in Israel: Will He Take On Israel's Surveillance State?\"","body":"\"TEL AVIV, ISRAEL -- Edward Snowden, the former U.S. government contractor who leaked classified information from the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013, will be speaking at an upcoming conference in Israel via video stream on November 6. The event, which is being hosted by Israeli media consultancy firm OH! Orenstein Hoshen, will be closed to the general public and attended only by \\\"specially invited guests.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to Israeli media reports, Snowden will be speaking on \\\"Israel-related issues\\\" to an Israeli-only audience and will take questions from the event's specially selected guests. Snowden's remarks will then be followed by statements from former Deputy Chief of the Mossad Ram Ben Barak, who currently serves as president of Israel-based private security consulting and intelligence firm Fortify Defense.\\n\\nDetails of the event were made public on Wednesday. According to Jewish Business News, during a negotiating process that lasted several months, Snowden's associates and Snowden himself \\\"have responded positively to OH! Orenstein Hoshen's request to speak to an Israeli audience for the first time\\\"\\n\\nRegarding Snowden's upcoming appearance, the firm stated:\\n\\nSnowden is a fascinating figure because his actions are so controversial. We have no intention of expressing support or an opinion on what he did. The audience will hear what he has to say, can ask tough questions and people can work out their own opinions on the matter.\\\"\\n\\nWithin Israel, Snowden's appearance via video conference is likely to invite controversy, given that many of the documents he leaked helped to expose the depth of U.S./Israeli intelligence sharing. For instance, documents from the Snowden cache revealed that the NSA shares raw signals intelligence, including information about innocent American citizens, with Israel's Unit 8200, the military intelligence branch of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).\\n\\nIn addition, the Snowden documents have shown that a U.S. government National Intelligence Estimate ranked Israel as \\\"the third most aggressive intelligence service against the U.S.\\\" for its targeting of U.S. government communications. The documents also revealed that the U.S. spied on Israeli government officials.\\n\\nIn 2014, journalist Glenn Greenwald - who received the full cache of the documents leaked by Snowden -- told Israel's Channel 10:\\n\\nThere were an enormous number of very important stories that have not yet been reported. There definitely remained stories related to the Middle East and Israel.\\\"\\n\\nIt is likely that many of those \\\"very important\\\" stories have yet to be reported on, as over 90 percent of the Snowden documents have not been made public.\\n\\nSnowden's upcoming appearance in Israel may be troubling for other reasons, however. Since having gained prominence as a whistleblower, Snowden has been a vocal advocate for free speech, freedom of the press, and privacy. However, the Israeli government routinely violates these rights for Palestinians as well as Israelis.\\n\\nIndeed, Israel has imprisoned Palestinians for writing poems, for organizing peaceful demonstrations, and for posting on social media. Israel also regularly imprisons Palestinian journalists for social-media posts and has pressured social-media companies like Facebook to censor Palestinian news outlets. Israel also targets activists who support the non-violent Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement that seeks to hold Israel accountable for its frequent violations of international law.\\n\\nThe Israeli military also regularly censors Israeli media outlets to such an extent that it averages one redaction every four hours. The IDF military censor has the power to censor all Israeli publications, including books and other print publications, a power stemming from a permanent state of emergency that has been in effect since Israel's founding in 1948. As Israeli magazine +972 recently noted:\\n\\nIsrael is the only [democracy] where journalists and publications are legally required to submit their reporting for review prior to publication and the only one where censorship can be criminally enforced.\\\"\\n\\nBeyond Israel's routine tramplings of the causes Snowden most ardently supports, there are other reasons for the whistleblower to reconsider his upcoming appearance before an exclusively Israeli audience. For instance, the IDF has been brutally suppressing unarmed protests in Gaza, having wounded over 22,000 unarmed protesters since March and having killed nearly 200 unarmed Gazans. Among those shot by the IDF in Gaza have been 12-year-old children, medics, and journalists. Furthermore, Israel recently legislated apartheid into its constitution through the controversial \\\"Nation State Law\\\" and, according to the UN, is actively seeking to illegally annex Palestine's West Bank, which has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967.\\n\\nMintPress has contacted Snowden for comment regarding his upcoming appearance in Israel and whether he has any stance on the BDS movement, Israel's apartheid policies, or the IDF's mass shooting of unarmed protesters in Gaza. No response had been received at the time of this article's publication.\\n\\nTop Photo | American whistleblower Edward Snowden can be seen on video screens at the 34th Chaos Communication Congress (34c3) at the fair grounds in Leipzig, Germany, Dec. 28, 2017.

The plan pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who challenged Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, would expand Medicare to cover almost everyone in the country, and current Medicare recipients would get improved benefits. Other Democratic plans would allow people to buy into a new government system modeled on Medicare, moving toward the goal of coverage for all while leaving private insurance in place.\\n\\nTrump's column comes as he is looking to paint Democratic candidates as extreme ahead of next month's midterm elections. A White House official speaking to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to describe internal plans said that Trump's health care attack will be echoed by the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups and that the president will continue to raise the attack during his campaign rallies.\\n\\nSanders responded Wednesday in a statement, saying Trump \\\"is lying about the Medicare for All proposal\\\" that he introduced.\\n\\n\\\"No, Mr. President. Our proposal would not cut benefits for seniors on Medicare. In fact, we expand benefits,\\\" Sanders said.\\n\\nAs Trump escalates his efforts on behalf of fellow Republicans, he is casting health care as one of an expanding list of choices for the electorate this year while seeking to raise the alarm about the consequences of Democratic control of the House or the Senate.\\n\\nMedicare for All, also called single-payer over the years, was until fairly recently outside the mainstream of Democratic politics, but this year it has become a key litmus test in many party primaries and a rallying cry for progressive candidates. Under the plan by Sanders, all Americans would gain access to government insurance with no copays or deductibles for medical services.\\n\\nRepublicans contend that the proposal would be cost-prohibitive and argue it marks government overreach.\\n\\nTrump has already sought to paint Democrats as extremists after the bitter confirmation battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and internal GOP polling obtained last month by the AP shows that the party believes the message will help galvanize Republican voters to the polls.\\n\\nAt a rally in Iowa on Tuesday, Trump argued that the only reason to vote for Democrats \\\"is if you are tired of winning.\\\" He will be holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday evening.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

The case before the justices Wednesday involves mostly long-term green card holders who have been convicted of a broad range of crimes that make them eligible to be deported.\\n\\nImmigration law says that noncitizens convicted of certain crimes should be detained when they are released from federal or state custody and then held while an immigration court decides whether or not they should be deported.\\n\\nBut those affected by the law aren't always detained immediately and are sometimes not detained until years later. One of the lead plaintiffs in the case is Mony Preap, a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1981. He has two convictions for possession of marijuana and was released from custody in 2006. But he wasn't taken into immigration custody until 2013.\\n\\nPreap and others in his position, who are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, argue that if they're not promptly detained after being released from custody and are instead picked up at some later date, their detention isn't mandatory. They say in that case they're entitled to a hearing to argue to an immigration judge that they aren't a danger to the community and are not likely to flee. If a judge agrees, they can then be released on bond. That's the same hearing rule that applies to other noncitizens the government is trying to deport.\\n\\nThe Trump administration argues, as the Obama administration did, against any hearing for former inmates affected by the law. The government says their detention is mandatory regardless of when they are picked up.\\n\\nIn Preap's case, which is a class-action lawsuit brought in California, and a similar class-action lawsuit brought in the state of Washington, courts found the government had to provide bond hearings. The San Francisco-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit agreed. Other appeals courts have sided with the government in similar cases. Preap has since won his deportation case.\\n\\nFollow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jessicagresko\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

They were expected to make a run at being the first team to repeat since the New England Patriots won title games after the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\\n\\nThe Eagles (2-3) head into Thursday night's game at MetLife Stadium against the Giants (1-4), looking to avoid their first three-game losing streak since the 2016 season. A fourth loss would be more than they had last season.\\n\\nWhile some might point to a Super Bowl hangover, it's also a combination of having a target on their backs, injuries and bad play.\\n\\n\\\"We know we're going to get everybody's best and we've seen it already this season,\\\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said.\\n\\n\\\"I've addressed the team that way. It doesn't mean we have to; it's not about panic mode or anything in that nature, it's just a heightened sense of urgency. The mistakes we're making are self-inflicted and it's keeping us from possibly winning a game or two here or there, and we understand that.\\\"\\n\\nSo do the Giants. They have not played horribly in coach Pat Shurmur's first season. They are not making enough plays, and too many mistakes.\\n\\nOdell Beckham Jr., who caught a touchdown and threw another in the Giants' 33-31 loss to Carolina last weekend, is glad this is a short week and the Eagles are the opponent in the weak NFC East where no team has a winning record.\\n\\n\\\"Defending Super Bowl champs coming in here, Thursday night game, but right now the focus is more on this just one game, and not putting so much pressure on what it could do for us,\\\" Beckham said. \\\"But this is a game that we need to win against a division rival.\\\"\\n\\nThe Eagles have won the past three against New York and seven of eight.\\n\\nBeckham doesn't care.\\n\\n\\\"There's always a team each and every year where everything is right for them,\\\" Beckham said of the Eagles.\\n\\n\\\"Even watching them last year, there was third downs, third-and-7s -- they got all of them. It's just the little stuff that was going on for them all year that was happening that allowed them to win each and every game. I don't know if I've seen that in the past games.\\\"\\n\\nHere are a couple of things to watch:\\n\\nSTOPPING ERTZ\\n\\nEagles tight end Zach Ertz has at least 10 catches and 100 receiving yards in each of his past two games. He is looking to become the fifth player in league history to record three consecutive 10-catch, 100-yard games. The Giants have the league's eighth-best pass defense, and that's with only six sacks this season. New York safety Landon Collins also does a good job in slowing down opposing tight ends. Expect to see him go against Ertz.\\n\\nSCOUTING SAQUON\\n\\nEagles defensive end Michael Bennett compared Saquon Barkley to a combination of Marshawn Lynch, LeSean McCoy and Jamaal Charles. Linebacker Jordan Hicks said the defense has to make sure it's aware of Barkley on every snap. Philadelphia had the NFL's best run defense last season and opponents are averaging 66.4 yards this year, with 42.4 yards by running backs.\\n\\n\\\"He's a dynamic player,\\\" Hicks said. \\\"He's used in many ways, he's a strong, physical runner and can make every cut. We have to contain him.\\\"\\n\\nSTERLING EFFORT\\n\\nGiants wide receiver Sterling Shepard has played against the Eagles four times and caught a touchdown in every game. He had two big games last season, catching a total of 18 passes for 272 yards and two touchdowns. Shepard might have something to prove this week. He ran the wrong route Sunday and it led to an interception. The third-year pro took out his frustration on a bench and a garbage can. \\\"I really wanted to win that game. That's the bottom line. I felt it kind of slipping away right there.\\\"\\n\\nWHERE'S THE RUSH?\\n\\nThe Eagles only have 12 sacks this season and the inability of the front four to bring down quarterbacks has hurt because coordinator Jim Schwartz doesn't like to blitz and relies on the linemen to get sacks. As a result, the pass defense has suffered. Eli Manning gets the ball out quickly, but he's been sacked 16 times this season.\\n\\n\\\"We can rush better, we can get to the quarterback more,\\\" three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \\\"The defensive line drives this team. We have to do better.\\\"\\n\\nKICKING GAME\\n\\nJake Elliott of the Eagles has made seven straight field goals. He also beat the Giants with a 61-yarder last season. Coincidently, Graham Gano beat New York with a 63-yarder last weekend. Aldrick Rosas of the Giants has been perfect this season making all 11 of his field goals and seven extra points. He has an injured quad and his status is uncertain. Marshall Koehn, who was in training camp, was signed to the practice squad Tuesday.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de35662b2"},"title":"\"Grizzlies have high expectations with Gasol, healthy Conley\"","body":"\"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The Memphis Grizzlies know only too well that they won't outshoot or race up and down the court with the likes of Golden State and Houston. Their version of grit 'n grind that got them to seven straight playoff berths might not work with this current roster.\\n\\nBut Memphis still has guard Mike Conley and center Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies know who they are and that they need to play defense to be competitive in the loaded Western Conference.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to be a contrarian team, and we've had a lot of success here over the years in this grit-grind era of being a contrarian team,\\\" Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said.\\n\\nMost of the Grizzlies' confidence stems from having Conley back from a heel injury that limited him to 12 games last season , and Conley averaged 17.1 points per game in his short stint. Gasol remains one of the NBA's top centers, and he and Conley are the NBA's longest-tenured teammates without any interruption.\\n\\nMemphis revamped the roster in the offseason, swapping some youth for more experienced players. The miserable 22-60 season at least netted the Grizzlies the No. 4 overall pick on forward Jaren Jackson Jr. of Michigan State.\\n\\n\\\"It's good as long as they have the mindset of winning and improving and the growth mindset,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"I think the young guys bring a breath of fresh air, a new swag, they call it.\\\"\\n\\nSome other things to know about the Grizzlies who open this season Oct. 17 at Indiana:\\n\\nGASOL'S FUTURE\\n\\nThe 7-foot-1 center, who turns 34 in January, can opt out of his contract next summer holding a $25 million player option. Gasol has started 709 of the 716 games he's played for the Grizzlies, and this will be the 11th season for a three-time All-Star who has yet to play in the NBA Finals. The closest Gasol and Memphis came was the 2013 Western Finals before being swept by San Antonio.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot promise you anything, or what the future is,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"What I can tell you is how much I'm going to put in this season and how much I care about the success of the team.\\\"\\n\\nANOTHER NEW COACH\\n\\nJ.B. Bickerstaff has plenty of experience taking over as interim coach first in Houston and last season with the Grizzlies when David Fizdale was fired in late November. The Grizzlies gave him the job in May, and Bickerstaff had an entire offseason to pick his own assistants and plan for the season.\\n\\nHEALTHY PARSONS\\n\\nForward Chandler Parsons played 34 games in his first season with Memphis, and he managed 36 games last season for the Grizzlies. He averaged 7.9 points per game and shot a career-high 42.1 percent from 3-point range. The Grizzlies need more, and Parsons, who signed a four-year, $94 million contract with Memphis in 2016 , believes his knee issues are past him after playing with no limitations this summer.\\n\\n\\\"Let's face it the last two years have gone horribly and not the way I planned, but the reasons why I came to Memphis are still all intact and with J.B. as the coach and still able to play with Mike and Marc and the fan base we have here is the reason I came here,\\\" Parsons said. \\\"And they're all three still in play.\\\"\\n\\nTRIPLE-J\\n\\nThe Grizzlies have whiffed on many draft picks during their tenure in Memphis. Conley, the fourth overall pick in 2007, is the rare first-round selection who has thrived. The Grizzlies need Jackson, the Big Ten defensive player of the year last season, to live up to the promise shown in his summer league debut, and the 19-year-old forward understands the expectations he faces. He said he embraces the pressure to prove himself. \\\"You feel it inside you,\\\" Jackson said. \\\"You just got to show everybody else.\\\"\\n\\nNEW SUPPORTING CAST\\n\\nThe Grizzlies signed Kyle Anderson, who started 67 games last season for San Antonio, with being ready to take a big step forward after signing him to a three-year, $37.2 million offer sheet. They traded away Ben McLemore and Deyonta Davis to Sacramento for Garrett Temple, who set career-highs last season for both points per game and 3-point percentage. Omri Casspi shot 58 percent overall and 45.5 percent beyond the arc for Golden State last season, while Shelvin Mack averaged a career-high 4.9 assists last season with Orlando. They also drafted Jevon Carter, who won both Big 12 defensive player of the year and the new Naismith defensive player of the year award.\\n\\nFollow Teresa M.

Forward Thaddeus Young opted to stay in town largely because of the locker room atmosphere.\\n\\nWith all five starters back, the Pacers will see if they can pick up where they left off. Indiana opens the season at home Oct. 17 against Memphis.\\n\\n\\\"The No. 1 thing is developing the chemistry,\\\" president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said. \\\"I think that's what made last year's team so good was their chemistry, how they got along. That's a process you never know how that's going to go. But we're bringing back our top seven in terms of minutes played, so we hope we can keep that chemistry and continue to build on it.\\\"\\n\\nMYLES AND MYLES\\n\\nThe Pacers' biggest desires for Turner over his first three seasons was seeing him get stronger so he could become a better rebounder. It appears Turner has finally fulfilled those goals. The 6-foot-11, 250-pound center documented his offseason transition in photos on social media, and it didn't take his teammates long to see a difference when he reported to training camp.\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to push myself to new limits, push my body, push my game and push my mindset,\\\" Turner said. \\\"I've been at this for three years and now I see the improvements and things getting better. It's exciting.\\\"\\n\\nBENCH MARK\\n\\nWhile Indiana let Lance Stephenson leave in free agency, Pritchard made a concerted effort to improve the bench. He signed veteran guard Tyreke Evans, a more consistent shooter, and forward Doug McDermott to replace Stephenson's scoring touch. Indiana also added size with the additional of 6-10, 250-pound forward Kyle O'Quinn. Pritchard said he was most impressed with two qualities O'Quinn brings to the table -- a penchant for setting picks and grabbing rebounds.\\n\\nDE-FENSE\\n\\nOladipo was last season's NBA steals champ, and Indiana demonstrated its defensive prowess by consistently holding the Cavaliers below their scoring average in the playoffs. This season, they could be even better.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know if we have the individual pieces to be a great defensive team, but I think collectively we can be,\\\" Pritchard said.\\n\\nYOUNG PROGRESSION\\n\\nThe Pacers aren't just looking to long-time veterans for help this season. They're also expecting to get key contributions from forward TJ Leaf, their little-used first-round pick in 2017, and point guard Aaron Holiday, their top pick this summer.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Indianapolis\"","lat":39,"lng":-86,"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de35662b5"},"title":"\"'I've got faith': Potential aluminum workers wait on jobs\"","body":"\"ASHLAND, Ky. -- Things fall through for Chris Jackson.\\n\\nA construction job, promised if he completed a carpentry program, vanished two weeks before his exit exam. A coveted, $100,000-a-year union job at a steel mill disappeared when the plant closed.\\n\\nNow a businessman is promising him -- and more than 130 others -- a job at an aluminum mill in eastern Kentucky if he can complete a two-year degree program with at least a B average and no positive drug tests. But the mill is not built, and its financing is not complete. It's a big risk for Jackson, a 41-year-old who turned down two other jobs hundreds of miles away for the chance to stay in his hometown.\\n\\nIt's also a risk for Kentucky taxpayers. The state has offered its usual package of economic incentives to the company, Braidy Industries. But in a rare move, the state legislature unanimously approved a $15 million investment in the project, making taxpayers partial owners of the mill. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, seeking re-election in 2019, has touted the project as evidence of his leadership to bring jobs to Appalachia, where steady work that pays well has been hard to find.\\n\\nBut what has been touted as a sure thing has recently shown signs of uncertainty. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, company officials revealed they haven't raised enough money yet to complete construction. They need another $400 million to $500 million. And while a website touting the company's stock offering notes \\\"200 percent of the mill's capacity for the next seven years has been reserved,\\\" the SEC filing says prospective buyers are not \\\"contractually committed.\\\"\\n\\nIt's enough to worry Jackson, who says his future depends on the mill.\\n\\n\\\"All my friends and family know I have put 110 percent into Braidy,\\\" said Jackson, who said his tuition is paid for by a federal program to help unemployed workers. \\\"Everyone starts questioning you, whether you made the right decision.\\\"\\n\\nCompany officials warned skeptics not to jump to conclusions based on their SEC filing, which is required to include a section on risks for investors. And they said it is \\\"commonly understood\\\" in the business world that sales at this stage of development are \\\"non-binding commitments to purchase.\\\"\\n\\nCraig Bouchard, Braidy's CEO, says he feels the pressure, too. He said the No. 1 reason he chose Ashland was not because the GOP-controlled legislature passed a \\\"right-to-work\\\" law that banned mandatory union dues from employees. He said he chose Ashland primarily because it and the surrounding area were filled with eager workers. Of the likely 600 jobs available, he said the company has received 7,000 applications.\\n\\n\\\"I wake up, literally every single morning with 10,000 families riding on my shoulders and it's the most important thing in my life, my career,\\\" he said.\\n\\nOne of those people is 24-year-old Holly Miller, who lives in nearby Ironton, Ohio. She started working when she was 16 in the cafeteria of a Christian university and has since bounced between retail and restaurant jobs. She's now in the two-year degree program for future Braidy workers. It will cost her at least $11,000, which she is paying with a mix of financial aid and her own money. She goes to class during the day, then works at Sam's Club from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. She says she sleeps an hour in the morning and an hour at night.\\n\\n\\\"Everything is really riding on (Braidy),\\\" she said. \\\"I mean, our whole livelihoods are riding on it.\\\"\\n\\nBouchard says the company has 45 employees and will expand to about 80 by the end of the year, with most of the 600 workers being hired next year. He insisted the company was on schedule to begin production in 2020.\\n\\n\\\"Whether it is in the second, third, fourth, fifth month of 2020, quite frankly I don't care,\\\" he said. \\\"I just want it to look good when it opens.\\\"\\n\\nThe site for the mill is next to the Ashland Community and Technical College, where 135 students are in their first year of a two-year degree program. There is a waiting list to get in, according to Mike Tackett, the school's advance integrated technology coordinator. In an interview, Bouchard said anyone who completes the program with a B average and no drug tests would be guaranteed a job. Jackson and Miller said they have not been guaranteed a job, but have been promised an opportunity.\\n\\nJackson is studying physics, trigonometry and algebra in what he says is \\\"the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,\\\" even more difficult than quitting smoking. But he keeps going, he said, because \\\"I've got faith in this place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Those people make you believe it,\\\" he said of company officials. \\\"And if it doesn't happen, it's going to be a huge letdown because I've lost two years I can't get back. But, I think it's worth waiting on.\\\"\\n\\n____\\n\\nThis story has been corrected to fix the spelling of Braidy Industries CEO Craig Bouchard.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Ashland, Kentucky\"","lat":38,"lng":-82,"__v":0}

Their version of grit 'n grind that got them to seven straight playoff berths might not work with this current roster.\\n\\nBut Memphis still has guard Mike Conley and center Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies know who they are and that they need to play defense to be competitive in the loaded Western Conference.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to be a contrarian team, and we've had a lot of success here over the years in this grit-grind era of being a contrarian team,\\\" Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said.\\n\\nMost of the Grizzlies' confidence stems from having Conley back from a heel injury that limited him to 12 games last season , and Conley averaged 17.1 points per game in his short stint. Gasol remains one of the NBA's top centers, and he and Conley are the NBA's longest-tenured teammates without any interruption.\\n\\nMemphis revamped the roster in the offseason, swapping some youth for more experienced players. The miserable 22-60 season at least netted the Grizzlies the No. 4 overall pick on forward Jaren Jackson Jr. of Michigan State.\\n\\n\\\"It's good as long as they have the mindset of winning and improving and the growth mindset,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"I think the young guys bring a breath of fresh air, a new swag, they call it.\\\"\\n\\nSome other things to know about the Grizzlies who open this season Oct. 17 at Indiana:\\n\\nGASOL'S FUTURE\\n\\nThe 7-foot-1 center, who turns 34 in January, can opt out of his contract next summer holding a $25 million player option. Gasol has started 709 of the 716 games he's played for the Grizzlies, and this will be the 11th season for a three-time All-Star who has yet to play in the NBA Finals. The closest Gasol and Memphis came was the 2013 Western Finals before being swept by San Antonio.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot promise you anything, or what the future is,\\\" Gasol said. \\\"What I can tell you is how much I'm going to put in this season and how much I care about the success of the team.\\\"\\n\\nANOTHER NEW COACH\\n\\nJ.B. Bickerstaff has plenty of experience taking over as interim coach first in Houston and last season with the Grizzlies when David Fizdale was fired in late November. The Grizzlies gave him the job in May, and Bickerstaff had an entire offseason to pick his own assistants and plan for the season.\\n\\nHEALTHY PARSONS\\n\\nForward Chandler Parsons played 34 games in his first season with Memphis, and he managed 36 games last season for the Grizzlies. He averaged 7.9 points per game and shot a career-high 42.1 percent from 3-point range. The Grizzlies need more, and Parsons, who signed a four-year, $94 million contract with Memphis in 2016 , believes his knee issues are past him after playing with no limitations this summer.\\n\\n\\\"Let's face it the last two years have gone horribly and not the way I planned, but the reasons why I came to Memphis are still all intact and with J.B. as the coach and still able to play with Mike and Marc and the fan base we have here is the reason I came here,\\\" Parsons said. \\\"And they're all three still in play.\\\"\\n\\nTRIPLE-J\\n\\nThe Grizzlies have whiffed on many draft picks during their tenure in Memphis. Conley, the fourth overall pick in 2007, is the rare first-round selection who has thrived. The Grizzlies need Jackson, the Big Ten defensive player of the year last season, to live up to the promise shown in his summer league debut, and the 19-year-old forward understands the expectations he faces. He said he embraces the pressure to prove himself. \\\"You feel it inside you,\\\" Jackson said. \\\"You just got to show everybody else.\\\"\\n\\nNEW SUPPORTING CAST\\n\\nThe Grizzlies signed Kyle Anderson, who started 67 games last season for San Antonio, with being ready to take a big step forward after signing him to a three-year, $37.2 million offer sheet. They traded away Ben McLemore and Deyonta Davis to Sacramento for Garrett Temple, who set career-highs last season for both points per game and 3-point percentage. Omri Casspi shot 58 percent overall and 45.5 percent beyond the arc for Golden State last season, while Shelvin Mack averaged a career-high 4.9 assists last season with Orlando. They also drafted Jevon Carter, who won both Big 12 defensive player of the year and the new Naismith defensive player of the year award.\\n\\nFollow Teresa M.

A phone call to Hussain's lawyer was not immediately returned.\\n\\nHussain was the day-to-day operator of Prestige Limousine, and the son of the company's owner.\\n\\nState police and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash, the nation's deadliest transportation accident since an air crash outside Buffalo in February 2009 killed 50 people.\\n\\nThe limousine ran off the road Saturday at the bottom of a long hill in Schoharie, 25 miles west of Albany. The crash killed two pedestrians and all 18 people in the limo celebrating a woman's birthday.

Efforts were made to locate him, but a year later he was determined killed in action, with details unknown.\\n\\nMore than 70 years passed with no news. In 2012, an island villager spotted the wreckage, sold the wing of the plane to a museum and notified U.S. authorities.\\n\\nThe investigation closed in September 2017, determining the teeth and bone fragments found at the site were Bailey's.\\n\\n\\\"We really didn't get much detail about him from my mother or her parents or my dad. We knew that he had died heroically in aerial combat in Guadalcanal,\\\" said Wayne Tompkins, Bailey's nephew. \\\"The unfortunate reality is, (they) all died not really knowing for sure what had happened to him.\\\"\\n\\nTompkins and his brother are Bailey's closest living relative. They'll be back in Jackson County this weekend, as Bailey's remains are brought back and buried next to his parents.\\n\\nBailey is being buried with full military honors at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 13, at Chapel Cemetery in Parma. The ceremony is open to the public at the E. Michigan Avenue cemetery between Chapel and Dearing roads.\\n\\nTompkins' mother was Bailey's only sibling.

The device features a camera that uses artificial intelligence to automatically zoom as people move around during calls.\\n\\nSince Echo's release nearly four years ago, both Google and Apple have followed Amazon in releasing smart speakers designed for use with their other digital services -- some of them, at least. These speakers can serve as hub-like controllers for \\\"smart\\\" homes as people install appliances, lighting and security systems that can be controlled over the internet.\\n\\nPortal represents Facebook's entry into that fray. But pointing an artificially intelligent camera into peoples' homes could well raise other privacy questions.\\n\\n\\\"The first thing consumers are going to wonder is 'how much sensitive data is this collecting about me?'\\\" said John Breyault, vice president of public policy of telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumers League, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group that has received donations from Facebook and other tech companies.\\n\\nOn Monday, Twitter users were quick to point to Facebook's privacy fallacies and what they saw as the company's impudence in asking people to trust it with a camera called Portal inside their homes. Some compared it to the always-on, always-watching telescreens in George Orwell's dystopian novel \\\"1984.\\\" Others saw the gadget's appeal -- but not if it comes from Facebook.\\n\\nIt's a particularly trying time for Facebook to release a home camera. Earlier this year, the company had to acknowledge that as many as 87 million people may have had their data accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm that worked for the Trump campaign and aimed to use the data to influence elections. More recently, Facebook revealed that hackers managed to pierce its security to break into 50 million accounts.\\n\\nFacebook says it won't \\\"listen to, view or keep the contents\\\" of video calls, adding that the Portal camera won't use facial recognition or identify people in the video calls.\\n\\nThe device will allow users to disable the camera and microphone with a single tap and to lock it with a numerical passcode. There's also a physical camera cover to prevent recording.\\n\\nPortal will not display Facebook ads \\\"at this time,\\\" the company said, although it noted that third-party services such as music streaming might embed their own ads the same way they do on other devices.\\n\\nThe company says Facebook's privacy policy applies to Portal, since it uses Messenger for voice and video calls. Facebook executives have repeatedly said that the company does not use the contents of messages or calls for advertising purposes and will not do so in the future. Still, there are other, less direct possibilities for the future.\\n\\n\\\"This is going to gain (Facebook) not only a place in the smart home, but also data they may not have been able to collect before or understand before,\\\" said ABI Research analyst Jonathan Collins. This includes people's location, activities and interests -- \\\"all the reasons companies want to get into the home.\\\"\\n\\nThat said, Facebook says Portal does not collect any information about people's home, listening only for voice commands. The camera, when enabled, detects people as they walk into the room but does not identify specific people or record anything about people's homes, according to Facebook.\\n\\nFacebook will offer Portal in two sizes -- a $199 model with a 10-inch horizontal screen and a $349 \\\"Plus\\\" version with a 15.6-inch screen that can switch between vertical or horizontal orientations.\\n\\nBoth models also include an internet-connected speaker that features Amazon's voice-activated digital assistant, Alexa. Portal connects calls through Messenger, meaning that it can reach people who don't have a Portal themselves. And since Messenger can be used without a Facebook account, Portal users won't need a Facebook account to use it -- only Messenger.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"San Francisco\"","lat":37,"lng":-122,"__v":0}

Applications jumped 20 percent in the first week after they were announced compared with the same period last year, according to Angie Thompson, a Target spokeswoman.\\n\\nThe company is further raising its minimum wage, in stages, to $15 by 2020. Yet Amazon beat it to the punch just last week by announcing that it would boost its starting hourly wage to $15 on Nov. 1.\\n\\n\\\"It's an investment in the future growth of the company and to ensure that we can continue to hire, retain, and develop the best talent for years to come,\\\" said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations.\\n\\nAmazon, the nation's second-largest private employer after Walmart, says it wants to hire applicants quickly. Its online job ads stress not what is required but what isn't: \\\"No resume. No interview.\\\" Meanwhile, Walmart plans to manage the holiday rush by providing more hours to its part-time workers, a step it implemented just two years ago.\\n\\nIndeed, retailers are posting far more full-time jobs compared with last year, and fewer part-time positions, according to research by Indeed, a job-listing website. The proportion of retail jobs that are part time, like sales associates at clothing stores, plummeted this year compared with 2017.\\n\\nWith lesser resources, smaller retailers are struggling to keep up with the higher pay and greater perks. Steve Fusek, who owns Fusek's True Value Hardware in Indianapolis, says he had already found it a challenge to find workers who could reliably show up on time. Making matters worse, his store is just 10 miles from an Amazon warehouse and he expects to have to raise his starting hourly pay by a dollar or two from $10 to compete.\\n\\nRadial, an e-commerce company based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania that fills online orders for such retailers as Shoe Carnival, PetSmart and Kate Spade, has had to offer more perks than before. It wants to recruit more than 20,000 workers for its 22 distribution centers and five customer call centers.\\n\\nSean McCartney, an executive vice president, said Radial raised hourly pay for its holiday workers in four more markets than it did last year, though he wouldn't say which ones. The company is also offering bonuses of $1,000 or more in the most competitive markets to those who work during the crucial \\\"Black Friday\\\" weekend after Thanksgiving.\\n\\nThat bonus is helping keep Linda Connor-Lewis happy about her job packing online orders at Radial's warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky, even though her email inbox is stuffed with invitations to job fairs at rival companies. Though Connor-Lewis, 54, already has a permanent job with Radial, she plans to work 30 more hours of work a week on top of her current 40-hour schedule and expects to earn more in holiday bonuses than she did last year.\\n\\nAt XPO Logistics, a firm that specializes in shipping appliances, furniture, and other large items that Americans are increasingly willing to order online, plans are to hire 8,000 workers -- one-third more than last year. XPO is also installing 5,000 robots in its warehouses in the United States and Europe.\\n\\n\\\"The combination of man plus machine is the best way to give our customers an edge,\\\" said Bradley Jacobs, the company's CEO.\\n\\nD'Innocenzio reported from New York.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de35662ca"},"title":"\"Bob the Builder: Panthers' coach putting his stamp on things\"","body":"\"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Bob Boughner's favorite dinner spot used to be a sports pub in the minor-league hockey hotbed of Glens Falls, New York called Dango's, a place where the chicken wings were huge and most of the televisions were usually tuned to hockey.\\n\\nThese days, it's an upscale steakhouse called Mastro's.\\n\\nIf there's one constant of Boughner's life in hockey, it's that just about everything -- from refining a palate, to reaching the NHL, to transforming a hockey team -- takes time. And Boughner got a very tough reminder of that last season when the Florida Panthers missed the postseason by a single point in his inaugural year as their coach.\\n\\nSo here the Panthers go again, trying to become a playoff club. But with Boughner leading the charge, there's real belief that good things are coming.\\n\\n\\\"He's even more than advertised,\\\" Panthers president Matthew Caldwell said. \\\"His diligence, he's a player's coach but also very, very technical. He gets into the weeds and I think the players trust him, but he'll hold them accountable too. His ability to be there for the players but also correct them, not be too friendly with them, have strong standards, that's been excellent.\\\"\\n\\nBoughner won the job in Florida by selling Caldwell and the rest of the Panthers' leadership on a vision.\\n\\nHis message: Be patient.\\n\\nBoughner played 297 games in three different minor leagues, needing seven years to make the jump from NHL draftee to NHL player. Once he got to the top level, he never left, spending parts of 10 seasons with six franchises and being part of five deep runs in the Stanley Cup playoffs. He was a hard-nosed defenseman, someone whose pro-career-best of eight goals came during those Dango's-fueled days with the AHL's Adirondack Red Wings in 1993-94.\\n\\nHis coaching climb took time as well, going from an owner-coach-president of OHL team in his hometown of Windsor, Ontario to some NHL assistant stints and finally getting the head job in Florida in 2017.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't an easy road. It was a hard road,\\\" Boughner said. \\\"I earned it as a player and I had to work every day to stay there. And it was not like I had a secure spot every year, too. But I always worked hard to be a team guy and that's what has sort of turned into some of my coaching philosophy. I had to build it from the ground up. I miss playing every day, but coaching, there's something gratifying when it all comes together.\\\"\\n\\nHe feels that gratification coming in Florida.\\n\\nThe Panthers, who open their home schedule on Thursday against Columbus, won three playoff series in their third season of existence -- 1995-96. They've won zero series since, missing the playoffs entirely in 17 of the 21 seasons that followed their lone run to the Stanley Cup final. Boughner spent two seasons as part of the Panthers organization as a player, though he never made the NHL club.\\n\\nPanthers general manager Dale Tallon knew it would take time for Boughner's system to take root. Florida was 25-8-2 in its last 35 games last season, going from near the bottom of the Eastern Conference to just missing the postseason.\\n\\n\\\"I just like his whole attitude about everything,\\\" Tallon said. \\\"He's a straightforward, no-nonsense guy. His technical aspect is terrific. And he gets the player. He has good relationships with all the players.\\\"\\n\\nBoughner looks back at last season with the obvious tinge of disappointment.\\n\\nBut he also knows the growing pains were vital.\\n\\nMuch of the core from last season remains the core now, and those players know what makes Boughner tick -- and what makes his system work. There's a culture in place now, a level of expectation, a level of accountability.\\n\\nIt's what Boughner demanded from himself as a player, and it's his blueprint for what he wants as a coach.\\n\\n\\\"There's no more excuses,\\\" Boughner said. \\\"There's a point last year, maybe 10 or 15 games in, when we were on a trip and I couldn't wait to get off our plane and get to the hotel and tell the guys get into the meeting room. I sort of blew up, got a lot of things off my chest, and the guys sort started taking inventory of themselves. I think we've turned a corner now. I think we're ready now.\\\"\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Sunrise, Florida\"","lat":26,"lng":-80,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbe3ead08fbc42de35662cb"},"title":"\"Eagles struggling post Super Bowl, Giants still losing\"","body":"\"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- After turning over half their roster, it's not surprising the New York Giants are losing.\\n\\nThe defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles are another story. They were expected to make a run at being the first team to repeat since the New England Patriots won title games after the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\\n\\nThe Eagles (2-3) head into Thursday night's game at MetLife Stadium against the Giants (1-4), looking to avoid their first three-game losing streak since the 2016 season. A fourth loss would be more than they had last season.\\n\\nWhile some might point to a Super Bowl hangover, it's also a combination of having a target on their backs, injuries and bad play.\\n\\n\\\"We know we're going to get everybody's best and we've seen it already this season,\\\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said.\\n\\n\\\"I've addressed the team that way. It doesn't mean we have to; it's not about panic mode or anything in that nature, it's just a heightened sense of urgency. The mistakes we're making are self-inflicted and it's keeping us from possibly winning a game or two here or there, and we understand that.\\\"\\n\\nSo do the Giants. They have not played horribly in coach Pat Shurmur's first season. They are not making enough plays, and too many mistakes.\\n\\nOdell Beckham Jr., who caught a touchdown and threw another in the Giants' 33-31 loss to Carolina last weekend, is glad this is a short week and the Eagles are the opponent in the weak NFC East where no team has a winning record.\\n\\n\\\"Defending Super Bowl champs coming in here, Thursday night game, but right now the focus is more on this just one game, and not putting so much pressure on what it could do for us,\\\" Beckham said. \\\"But this is a game that we need to win against a division rival.\\\"\\n\\nThe Eagles have won the past three against New York and seven of eight.\\n\\nBeckham doesn't care.\\n\\n\\\"There's always a team each and every year where everything is right for them,\\\" Beckham said of the Eagles.\\n\\n\\\"Even watching them last year, there was third downs, third-and-7s -- they got all of them. It's just the little stuff that was going on for them all year that was happening that allowed them to win each and every game. I don't know if I've seen that in the past games.\\\"\\n\\nEagles tight end Zach Ertz has at least 10 catches and 100 receiving yards in each of his past two games. He is looking to become the fifth player in league history to record three consecutive 10-catch, 100-yard games. The Giants have the league's eighth-best pass defense, and that's with only six sacks this season. New York safety Landon Collins also does a good job in slowing down opposing tight ends. Expect to see him go against Ertz.\\n\\nSCOUTING SAQUON\\n\\nEagles defensive end Michael Bennett compared Saquon Barkley to a combination of Marshawn Lynch, LeSean McCoy and Jamaal Charles. Linebacker Jordan Hicks said the defense has to make sure it's aware of Barkley on every snap. Philadelphia had the NFL's best run defense last season and opponents are averaging 66.4 yards this year, with 42.4 yards by running backs.\\n\\n\\\"He's a dynamic player,\\\" Hicks said. \\\"He's used in many ways, he's a strong, physical runner and can make every cut. We have to contain him.\\\"\\n\\nSTERLING EFFORT\\n\\nGiants wide receiver Sterling Shepard has played against the Eagles four times and caught a touchdown in every game. He had two big games last season, catching a total of 18 passes for 272 yards and two touchdowns. Shepard might have something to prove this week. He ran the wrong route Sunday and it led to an interception. The third-year pro took out his frustration on a bench and a garbage can. \\\"I really wanted to win that game. That's the bottom line. I felt it kind of slipping away right there.\\\"\\n\\nWHERE'S THE RUSH?\\n\\nThe Eagles only have 12 sacks this season and the inability of the front four to bring down quarterbacks has hurt because coordinator Jim Schwartz doesn't like to blitz and relies on the linemen to get sacks. As a result, the pass defense has suffered. Eli Manning gets the ball out quickly, but he's been sacked 16 times this season.\\n\\n\\\"We can rush better, we can get to the quarterback more,\\\" three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \\\"The defensive line drives this team. We have to do better.\\\"\\n\\nKICKING GAME\\n\\nJake Elliott of the Eagles has made seven straight field goals. He also beat the Giants with a 61-yarder last season. Coincidently, Graham Gano beat New York with a 63-yarder last weekend. Aldrick Rosas of the Giants has been perfect this season making all 11 of his field goals and seven extra points. He has an injured quad and his status is uncertain. Marshall Koehn, who was in training camp, was signed to the practice squad Tuesday. He has kicked in one NFL regular-season game.\\n\\nAP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this story.\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"East Rutherford, New Jersey\"","lat":40,"lng":-74,"__v":0}

And he's having a lot of fun doing it.\\n\\n\\\"When you see some of the throws (Mahomes) makes, it kind of gives me the green light to try to make any throw I want to make,\\\" the Patriots' veteran backup QB said Wednesday. \\\"Maybe try to fit a ball in where I wouldn't always. It's always fun for me to emulate a different offense, because whether it's read option, RPOs, whatever it may be, it's always an opportunity to get better as a quarterback.\\\"\\n\\nUnlike the Patriots' defensive players, Hoyer said he hasn't closely studied Mahomes' game ahead of Sunday night's Pats-Chiefs matchup at Gillette Stadium. Even as a backup, his primary focus needs to be on Kansas City's defense.\\n\\nBut, like everyone else, he's the remarkable things Mahomes has been able to do on the field this season.\\n\\n\\\"I watched the Sunday night highlights or whatever it is,\\\" Hoyer said. \\\"I remember that throw he made to (tight end Travis) Kelce against Pittsburgh. It basically knocked Kelce down. I mean, it was incredible. If you're a football fan, you know about other guys, and everything you've ever heard about Patrick Mahomes is his arm strength, and he's definitely proven that this year.\\\"\\n\\nHe added: \\\"When you're the son of a major league pitcher (Pat Mahomes), that's kind of in your DNA, right?\\\"\\n\\nThe 32-year-old Hoyer knows he can't properly replicate that arm strength -- few quarterbacks can -- or Mahomes' scrambling ability. As they did before their matchup with Deshaun Watson in Week 1, the Patriots have used non-QBs to simulate the latter, with practice squad running back Kenneth Farrow taking snaps during a defensive line contain drill earlier this week.\\n\\n\\\"If there's a play that's similar to what we do, I always try to just do it the way we would do it,\\\" Hoyer explained. \\\"But there's a lot of times where that's not the case and I'm trying to put myself in that quarterback's shoes and make a good play. I realize I'm servicing the defense. When it comes down to it, the best thing I can do it give them the best look.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Hoyer agreed to return to New England following the Jimmy Garoppolo trade, he knew he'd only see game action if Tom Brady went down with an injury or the score was sufficiently lopsided.

In a unanimous decision, the commissioners sided with an administrative law judge's recommendation issued last month.\\n\\nCommissioners said their siting authority is subject to thresholds set in state law, which is 50,000 barrels per day for refineries. Meridian CEO Bill Prentice said in an affidavit that the company has \\\"no current plans\\\" to expand the Davis Refinery beyond 49,500 barrels per day.\\n\\n\\\"This is a close call. It's a tough call,\\\" said Public Service Commissioner Julie Fedorchak. \\\"All indications suggest that the company is developing plans to avoid the additional regulatory scrutiny required of a siting permit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the fact remains that the PSC is a regulatory body and we must have subject matter jurisdiction to preside over any matter,\\\" she added.\\n\\nRandy Christmann, who chairs the three-member, all-Republican PSC, said their decision doesn't reflect whether the refinery will be built in an \\\"appropriate location.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dakota Resource Council and the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which filed the complaint, said the PSC chose to \\\"trust the company at its word.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The PSC's decision ignores its duty as an independent utility regulator and the rights of North Dakotans to seek formal determinations from the PSC,\\\" the groups said in a statement. \\\"This is a pivotal decision that could broadly affect the PSC's ability to regulate everything from electric rates, to coal mines, to wind siting, and oil refinery siting, and it should concern all North Dakotans.\\\"\\n\\nThe groups said they are reviewing next steps with legal counsel and raised the possibility of appealing the commission's decision in district court.\\n\\nThe refinery still faces obstacles, including an administrative appeal filed against Meridian and the state Department of Health, which granted an air permit for the project earlier this year. The air permit describes the project as having a capacity of up to 55,000 barrels per day, above the threshold that would trigger a PSC siting review.\\n\\nThe entire facility would be subject to review and approval once plans to increase the facility to at least 50,000 barrels per day are implemented, according to the commission's order. The order was not included on the commission's publicly available agenda ahead of the meeting.\\n\\nIn an emailed statement, Meridian thanked the PSC for its \\\"careful consideration\\\" and lauded state and local officials involved in permitting the refinery to ensure it will be \\\"designed, constructed and operated properly.\\\"\\n\\nFedorchak predicted the siting thresholds will be discussed during next year's legislative session.\\n\\n\\\"I've already heard talk of people bringing forward bills,\\\" she said. \\\"This is a good time to have this discussion.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"North Dakota\"","lat":47,"lng":-100,"__v":0}

In a unanimous decision, the commissioners sided with an administrative law judge's recommendation issued last month.\\n\\nCommissioners said their siting authority is subject to thresholds set in state law, which is 50,000 barrels per day for refineries.

Fix the system. Don't break it.\\\"\\n\\nShe acknowledged that the World Trade Organization, based in Geneva, has made scant headway in recent years toward a global agreement on trade rules that can address issues like complaints over Chinese policies U.S. President Donald Trump says unfairly extract advanced technologies and put foreign companies at a disadvantage in a quest to dominate certain industries.\\n\\n\\\"Our strong recommendation is to escalate work for a world trade system that is stronger, that is fairer and is fit for the purpose,\\\" she said in opening remarks.\\n\\nSomewhat obliquely, she said policies aimed toward an excessively \\\"dominant position\\\" were not compatible with free and fair trade.\\n\\nThe IMF has downgraded its forecast for global economic growth to 3.7 percent this year from its earlier estimate of 3.9 percent. It also issued reports this week on government finance and financial stability that warn of the risks of disruptions to world trade.\\n\\nWorld Bank President Jim Yong Kim said the World Bank is working with developing countries to brace for a further deterioration.\\n\\n\\\"Trade is very critical because that is what has lifted people out of extreme poverty,\\\" Kim said. \\\"I am a globalist. That is my job. That is our only chance of ending extreme poverty. We need more trade not less trade,\\\" he said.\\n\\nKim said the World Bank has launched a \\\"human capital index\\\" to help rank countries by the level of their investments in such areas as education and health care.\\n\\nPolicies to build such human capital are among the \\\"smartest investments countries can make,\\\" he said.\\n\\nHe praised host country Indonesia, a democratic, Muslim-majority country of 260 million, for fostering strong growth but noted there was much room for improvement. The country is ranked 87th of 150 countries in the list.\\n\\nIndonesia has endured a slew of disasters in recent months. Before dawn on Thursday, an earthquake collapsed homes on Indonesia's Java island, killing at least three people just two weeks after a major quake and tsunami disaster in a central region of the archipelago killed more than 2,000 people and left perhaps thousands more buried deeply in mud.\\n\\nThursday's magnitude 6.0 quake offshore north of Bali shook the area where the IMF-World Bank delegates are meeting, but there were no signs of significant damage.\\n\\nThe annual financial meetings take place at a time of growing concern over trends other than trade, such as moves to raise borrowing costs in the U.S. and some other regions to help cool growth and keep inflation in check. Rising interest rates are drawing investment flows out of emerging markets in Asia and Latin America at a time when growth in their exports is likely to slow.\\n\\nArgentina and Pakistan, Venezuela and Zimbabwe are among countries grappling with crises. Concerns are growing, also, over slowing growth in China and rising debts among some developing countries resulting from projects associated with Beijing's \\\"Belt and Road Initiative\\\" to develop ports, roads and other infrastructure.\\n\\nLagarde said the IMF will send a team to Pakistan in the coming weeks after a meeting with its finance minister, Asad Umar, in which he requested emergency bailout loans.\\n\\nThe IMF chief did not say how much Umar had requested. Analysts say Pakistan is seeking $8 billion in loans to deal with a balance of payments crisis. Pakistan's currency plunged by around 7 percent earlier this week after word of the loan request was made public.\\n\\nAsked whether IMF help might amount to a \\\"bailout\\\" for Chinese loans, Lagarde said any such help would have to be completely transparent.\\n\\n\\\"In whatever work we do we need a complete understanding and complete transparency about the nature of a debt that is bearing on a country,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe annual summit for global finance brings together central bankers and finance ministers, development experts and civil society groups from across the globe.\\n\\nBali has suffered terrorist bombings in the past, and the event was being held amid tight security. A convoy of armed personnel carriers was lined up alongside a beach path and access to the area was tightly controlled.\\n\\nStill, about a dozen activists concerned with land grabs and other issues sometimes associated with World Bank-sponsored projects staged a brief, peaceful protest over the cancellation by local authorities of a conference they were to hold in the nearby city of Denpasar.\\n\\n\\\"If they don't want to ever hear our voices, what kinds of projects are we expecting?\\\" said Joan Salvador, a member of a Philippine women's group.\\n\\nThose involved had badges allowing them to enter the tightly guarded venue, and an IMF official said she would convey their concerns \\\"to the highest levels.\\\"\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press journalist Hau Dinh contributed to this report.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Indonesia\"","lat":-5,"lng":120,"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8eda"},"title":"\"West Texas an 'extraction colony' as oil, gas exports surge\"","body":"\"MIDLAND, Texas -- Drilling booms have come and gone in this oil town for nearly a century. But the frenzy gripping it now is different. Overwhelming. Drilling rigs tower over suburban backyards. There's a housing crunch so severe that rents are up 30 percent in the last year alone.\\n\\nThis boom is engulfing the rest of West Texas, extending to areas that drilling hasn't touched before. As communities welcome new jobs and business, they're struggling with an onslaught of problems from spikes in traffic accidents to student homelessness.\\n\\nWhat's happening is unprecedented. In December, companies in the Permian Basin -- an ancient, oil-rich seabed that spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico -- produced twice as much oil as they had four years earlier, during the last boom. Forecasters expect production to double again by 2023.\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and others say the drilling spree is ushering in a new era of American energy independence, but American demand isn't driving it. Foreign demand is.\\n\\nIn late 2015, Congress cut a deal to lift 40-year-old restrictions on the export of crude oil. Three years later, the U.S. has surpassed Russia as the world's top oil producer. The International Energy Agency predicts that American oil -- mostly from the Permian -- will account for 80 percent of the growth in global supply through 2025. That's good for corporate profits but bad for air quality in places with heavy drilling. It also threatens to exacerbate climate change.\\n\\n__\\n\\nThis story is part of a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Texas Tribune, The Associated Press and Newsy.\\n\\n__\\n\\nHydraulic fracturing -- better known as fracking -- made this boom technologically possible, but exports are the reason there's so much new drilling. U.S. refineries built for heavier varieties of oil than the Permian produces can't handle the enormous new quantities of Texas light crude. Instead, companies are shipping it abroad.\\n\\nThe lifting of export restrictions \\\"is tantamount to one of the most important things that's ever been done for the industry,\\\" said Tim Dove, chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources, based near Dallas.\\n\\nBut the country is not \\\"energy independent\\\" in the way most Americans would conceive of the idea. Nor can anyone promise that America, as Abbott put it in a recent tweet, \\\"will NEVER AGAIN depend on Foreign Oil Cartels for energy.\\\"\\n\\nThat's because the U.S. is still importing oil: 1.4 billion barrels in the first half of this year alone, a third of it from the foreign oil cartel known as OPEC.\\n\\nThe country will keep buying oil from other nations indefinitely even as it sells more abroad, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts.\\n\\nThe Texas Tribune and the Center for Public Integrity investigated the scope and impacts of energy exports as part of a collaboration with Newsy and The Associated Press.\\n\\nIn Texas, the boom is sending a lot of money into state and local coffers. Oil and gas tax revenue is up more than 50 percent this year. Said James LeBas, a Texas Oil and Gas Association economist: \\\"When oil and gas is doing well, the state is doing well.\\\"\\n\\nStill, climbing production hasn't boosted local tax revenues fast enough to address the problems that come with it, from crowded classrooms to wrecked roads. Schools, police departments and hospitals are struggling to keep employees lured by better-paying oilfield jobs.\\n\\nTexas regulators, long criticized for being too industry-friendly, also aren't aggressively tracking or policing problems that accompany the boom. For example, the Texas portion of the Permian -- roughly the size of Georgia -- has only a few air pollution monitoring stations, leaving residents largely in the dark about what's in the air they breathe.\\n\\nAnd the industry is consuming water in an arid region at an unsustainable rate. Permian Basin operators used eight times as much water to frack and drill last year as they did in 2011.\\n\\nPeople with no say in these decisions are stuck with the consequences, said Coyne Gibson, who lives in a part of the Permian that had little oil and gas activity until a few years ago.\\n\\n\\\"The bitter, cynical way to look at this is, West Texas becomes an extraction colony for the fuel resources for the rest of the world,\\\" said Gibson, a Big Bend Conservation Alliance volunteer who once worked in the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nGlobally, there are major trade-offs, too. Scientists warn this drilling rush almost certainly will worsen climate change by increasing the world's fossil fuel use at a fraught time. They say drastic reductions in greenhouse gases are needed to avoid intensifying climate-linked disasters.\\n\\nTwo massive wildfires in California this summer were among the largest in state history. Record-high temperatures in Japan killed more than 100 people in July. September's Hurricane Florence was the most devastating storm ever to hit the Carolinas, while Texas communities are still struggling to recover from Hurricane Harvey, which shattered U.S. rainfall records last year.\\n\\n\\\"Every additional gigaton of carbon that we produce as a global society carries with it a very real cost,\\\" said Katharine Hayhoe, who directs the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University.\\n\\nMeanwhile, companies are building oil and gas infrastructure meant to last decades -- including more than 8,000 miles of pipeline in Texas alone, enough to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific three times over.\\n\\nThe new infrastructure makes it \\\"very unlikely that we can dramatically curtail fossil fuel use,\\\" said Richard York, an environmental studies and sociology professor at the University of Oregon.\\n\\n__\\n\\n'I JUST HAD TO STOP BREATHING'\\n\\nThe headaches come almost every day. Some mornings Suzanne Franklin wakes with a nose full of dried blood, her voice filled with gravel. Her husband Jim suffers from respiratory problems, too.\\n\\nWhen Franklin moved to Reeves County in 2010, this remote area roughly 100 miles southwest of Midland was a modest oil and gas producer by Texas standards. Now it ranks third in the state for both. Oil production in the county -- which has fewer than 16,000 residents and more land than Delaware -- skyrocketed from 1.6 million barrels in 2010 to more than 60 million last year, the biggest upturn in the Permian.\\n\\nA sign near one of the new wells, less than a mile from the Franklins, warns of the presence of hydrogen sulfide, a contaminant in crude oil and natural gas. In high concentrations it can kill almost instantly; at low levels it can cause chronic illness.\\n\\nA chemical stench hangs in the air here.\\n\\n\\\"When we went past that site yesterday, I could not believe how bad it was,\\\" Suzanne Franklin said in April. \\\"I just had to stop breathing.\\\"\\n\\nComplaints like hers are common among people who live near gas sites, academic research has found. Flares burning off gas spew pollutants that assault the respiratory system.\\n\\nSites flaring natural gas -- a fossil fuel hitchhiker that comes up with the oil here -- are everywhere in the region. From 2016 through May of this year, the Texas Railroad Commission -- which oversees oil and gas production, not railroads -- issued more than 6,300 permits allowing companies to flare in the Permian, compared to 571 in the entire state from 2008 through 2010.\\n\\nRailroad Commission Chairman Christi Craddick thinks the flaring is a shame -- a waste -- but not an urgent reason for a regulatory crackdown. She called the rules sufficient and well-enforced, adding: \\\"Certainty in regulation is important for industry.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to flaring, oil and gas sites release pollutants during \\\"air emission events\\\" -- pollution releases they characterize as unforeseeable, prompted by equipment malfunctions or other problems. If the state agrees they were unavoidable -- and it almost always does -- they don't count against limits established in state permits that companies must obtain.\\n\\n\\\"These are off-the-books -- they're not levels that are authorized in their air pollution permits, but they're happening routinely,\\\" said Ilan Levin, associate director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a research and advocacy group.\\n\\nLast year, businesses in Texas counties atop the Permian reported pumping out 77,000 tons of pollutants during emission events, largely carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. A single gas processing facility in Pecos County reported 103 such events over the 16 months ending in April, or one every five days.\\n\\nYet punishment is rare. A 2017 investigation by The Texas Tribune found that the agency that regulates air pollution, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, hardly ever fines companies when they bust air permit limits. And only four air pollution monitors are stationed in producing areas of the Texas Permian.\\n\\nThe commission said its monitoring and enforcement comply with state and federal law.\\n\\n\\\"Any violations that are documented during TCEQ investigations are addressed using standard agency protocols and are handled consistently statewide,\\\" the agency said in a written statement. It declined to make officials available for interviews.\\n\\n__\\n\\nTHE DESERT'S WATER\\n\\nBalmorhea, population 550, has never been an oil-and-gas hub. It's a tourist destination, thanks to its namesake state park that draws more than 200,000 visitors a year to enjoy the world's largest spring-fed swimming pool -- an acre-plus expanse of blue-green water that pops amid the desert landscape.\\n\\nBut now producers have come for the fossil fuels. Two years ago, Houston-based Apache Corporation announced it had discovered vast oil and gas deposits in the area and leased more than 300,000 acres.\\n\\nWorries about the ancient springs that feed the pool and supply water to Balmorhea and nearby Toyahvale prompted the TCEQ to install a water quality monitoring station in the state park and spawned at least five studies. Apache contributed money for three of them.\\n\\n\\\"We spent considerable time and effort conducting baseline air, water and soil studies and cultural, historical and surface impact assessments before development began,\\\" Apache spokeswoman Castlen Kennedy said in a written statement.\\n\\nThe company promised not to drill within the city limits or the state park, but it isn't waiting for the results of all the studies to exploit its new oil and gas play, known as Alpine High. It plans to drill 5,000 wells in the coming decades.\\n\\nContamination isn't the only water fear. Some worry the industry will use too much in a region already struggling with drought.\\n\\nOil and gas companies consumed nearly 58 billion gallons to frack and drill last year in the entire basin, the consulting firm IHS Markit estimated, far outstripping the 6.8 billion used in 2011. By 2023, that's expected to jump to nearly 130 billion gallons -- 19 times the amount of water Midland used last year.\\n\\nThere isn't a state agency policing groundwater use. That's left to local conservation districts with differing opinions about how much to limit water withdrawals or even whether, in cases involving oil and gas, they have any authority to regulate.\\n\\nAnd substantial parts of West Texas don't have a district: Legally, people in those areas can pull as much water from their property as they can pump.\\n\\nThe consequences of the increased water use are unclear: Major data gaps hinder such investigations, said Bridget Scanlon, a senior research scientist for the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology. For example, the state doesn't require companies to divulge the type of water they're using -- such as fresh or brackish -- for their drilling operations.\\n\\nA 2017 study by researchers at the University of Texas found that more than enough contaminated water, known as \\\"produced water,\\\" was flowing up from oil and gas wells to meet industry demand -- if it had been recycled. Instead, most producers inject it into underground disposal wells, which have been linked to earthquakes.\\n\\nSome Permian producers are now recycling. Apache says it's already reusing 80 percent of its produced water in Alpine High and is aiming for 100 percent.\\n\\nBut the state doesn't require recycling. The Railroad Commission merely tweaked its rules to make the practice easier.\\n\\n\\\"I call it the carrot -- ?not the stick -- ?approach,\\\" said Craddick, the commission's chairman. \\\"Water protection and, frankly, protecting the environment is a priority for us.\\\"\\n\\nToyahvale resident Neta Rhyne thinks that's a complete misrepresentation.\\n\\n\\\"Why are they destroying our beautiful desert oasis to send oil to Asia?\\\" she said.\\n\\n__\\n\\nTHE OVERWHELMING BOOM\\n\\nThe superintendent of Ector County's school district teared up this spring as he talked about problems that have come with the oil boom.\\n\\nStudent enrollment has doubled in six years. Classrooms are overcrowded. Staffers keep leaving for oilfield jobs; the district is a few hundred teachers short and new hires can't find anywhere they can afford to live. Homelessness among students spiked 26 percent last academic year, with more than 2,100 living in shelters, doubling up with other families or otherwise displaced as housing costs outpace wages.\\n\\n\\\"The thing that really keeps me up at night is, are we giving the kids everything they deserve?\\\" then-Superintendent Tom Crowe said in an April interview, a few months before he retired. \\\"I get emotional about it. I've been doing this a long time and every day I worry, is there a kid out there who slips through the cracks?\\\"\\n\\nThe boom is straining communities across the Permian. Midland County has seen rents rise so fast -- 65 percent since 2010 -- that it's now the most expensive place to lease a home in the state, with Ector County close behind, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development figures.\\n\\nThen there's the traffic -- outright frightening in some places as heavy trucks have multiplied. In Winkler County, population 7,600, accidents are up more than 70 percent this year.\\n\\nOil-related traffic is also chewing up pavement on roads and bridges that weren't designed to carry such heavy loads. Texas Department of Transportation data show the increase in traffic brought by the boom has damaged more than 3,000 miles of state highways in Permian counties. The agency has $3.4 billion worth of projects planned for the area over the next decade -- an investment it describes as \\\"historic\\\" -- but, as of the end of July, it estimated that it still needs more than $1.1 billion for repair work and safety upgrades.\\n\\nOil and gas companies, along with firms that serve them, have responded by paying for some road safety projects and providing housing for their workers.\\n\\nAs they confront the boom's downsides, local leaders across the Permian must make educated guesses about the best ways to respond, laying their bets on how much Permian oil and gas the world will snap up -- and for how long.\\n\\nCraddick, the Railroad Commission chairman who grew up in Midland, said no one can predict a boom's duration, but \\\"I don't think that this is going away in a generation or more.\\\"\\n\\nThe city at the center of the export boom is trying to settle in for the long haul. Leaders have choices to make -- uncomfortable ones.\\n\\nIn April, Midland City Council members looked tortured as they discussed a new drainage fee based on how much concrete covers a property -- common in Texas but anathema to this conservative stronghold -- so they could pay for basic city services.\\n\\nThey reluctantly voted in favor.\\n\\nDefending the decision, council member Scott Dufford put into words the fear of every town strapped to a rocket it can't steer, powered by companies selling Permian crude to the world: \\\"If we do nothing, we're going to be in even more trouble in 10 years.\\\"\\n\\n__\\n\\nTexas Tribune journalists Brandon Formby and Chris Essig, and Center for Public Integrity news developer Pratheek Rebala contributed to this article.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Midland, Texas\"","lat":31,"lng":-102,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8edb"},"title":"\"Saudis sought to lure missing journalist in order to detain him, U.S. intercepts show\"","body":"\"WASHINGTON - The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered an operation to lure Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia and then detain him, according to U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan.\\n\\nThe intelligence, described by U.S. officials familiar with it, is another piece of evidence implicating the Saudi regime in Khashoggi's disappearance last week after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials say that a Saudi security team lay in wait for the journalist and killed him.\\n\\nKhashoggi was a prominent critic of the Saudi government and Mohammed in particular. Several of Khashoggi's friends said that over the past four months, senior Saudi officials close to the crown prince had called Khashoggi to offer him protection, and even a high-level job working for the government, if he returned to his home country.\\n\\nKhashoggi, however, was skeptical of the offers. He told one friend that the Saudi government would never make good on its promises not to harm him.\\n\\n\\\"He said: 'Are you kidding? I don't trust them one bit,' \\\" said Khaled Saffuri, an Arab American political activist, recounting a conversation he had with Khashoggi in May, moments after Khashoggi had received a call from Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to the royal court.\\n\\nThe intelligence pointing to a plan to detain Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia has fueled speculation by officials and analysts in multiple countries that what transpired at the consulate was a backup plan to capture Khashoggi that may have gone wrong.\\n\\nA former U.S. intelligence official - who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter - noted that the details of the operation, which involved sending two teams totaling 15 men, in two private aircraft arriving and departing Turkey at different times, bore the hallmarks of a \\\"rendition,\\\" in which someone is extralegally removed from one country and deposited for interrogation in another.\\n\\nBut Turkish officials have concluded that whatever the intent of the operation, Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate. Investigators have not found his body, but Turkish officials have released video surveillance footage of Khashoggi entering the consulate on the afternoon of Oct. 2. There is no footage that shows him leaving, they said.\\n\\nThe intelligence about Saudi Arabia's earlier plans to detain Khashoggi have raised questions about whether the Trump administration should have warned the journalist that he might be in danger.\\n\\nIntelligence agencies have a \\\"duty to warn\\\" people who might be kidnapped, seriously injured or killed, according to a directive signed in 2015. The obligation applies regardless of whether the person is a U.S. citizen. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident.\\n\\n\\\"Duty to warn applies if harm is intended toward an individual,\\\" said a former senior intelligence official. But that duty also depends on whether the intelligence clearly indicated Khashoggi was in danger, the former official said.\\n\\n\\\"Capturing him, which could have been interpreted as arresting him, would not have triggered a duty-to-warn obligation,\\\" the former official said. \\\"If something in the reported intercept indicated that violence was planned, then, yes, he should have been warned.\\\"\\n\\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the warning process, declined to comment on whether Khashoggi had been contacted.\\n\\nAdministration officials have not commented on the intelligence reports that showed a Saudi plan to lure Khashoggi.\\n\\n\\\"Though I cannot comment on intelligence matters, I can say definitively the United States had no advance knowledge of [Khashoggi's] disappearance,\\\" deputy State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters Wednesday. Asked whether the U.S. government would have had a duty to warn Khashoggi if it possessed information that he was in jeopardy, Palladino declined to answer what he called a \\\"hypothetical question.\\\"\\n\\nIt was not clear to officials with knowledge of the intelligence whether the Saudis discussed harming Khashoggi as part of the plan to detain him in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nBut the intelligence had been disseminated throughout the U.S. government and contained in reports that are routinely available to people working on U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia or related issues, one U.S. official said.\\n\\nThe intelligence poses a political problem for the Trump administration because it implicates Mohammed, who is particularly close to Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton spoke by phone with the crown prince, but White House officials said the Saudis provided little information.\\n\\nTrump has grown frustrated, two officials said, after initially reacting slowly to Khashoggi's disappearance. Earlier this week, he said he had no information about what had happened to the journalist.\\n\\nWhite House officials have begun discussing how to force Saudi Arabia to provide answers and what punishment could be meted out if the government there is found responsible.\\n\\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have reacted harshly to the disappearance. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators asked Trump to impose sanctions on anyone found responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance, including Saudi leaders.\\n\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., perhaps the president's closest ally in the Senate, predicated a \\\"bipartisan tsunami\\\" of action if the Saudis were involved and said that Khashoggi's death could alter the nature of relations between the two countries.\\n\\nKushner's relationship with Mohammed, known within national security agencies by the initials MBS, has long been the subject of suspicion by some American intelligence officials.\\n\\nKushner and Mohammed have had private, one-on-one phone calls that were not always set up through normal channels so the conversations could be memorialized and Kushner could be properly briefed.\\n\\nFor all his criticism of the Saudi regime, Khashoggi was not always opposed to Mohammed's policies. Khashoggi credited the young leader for what he saw as positive changes, including loosening Saudi cultural restrictions.\\n\\nKhashoggi often expressed affection for his homeland, even while saying he did not believe it was safe for him. One person in contact with the crown prince, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preserve the relationship, said Khashoggi last year asked him to give a message to Mohammed saying he needed someone like Khashoggi as an adviser.\\n\\nWhen he transmitted the message, this person said, the crown prince said that Khashoggi was tied to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Qatar, both Saudi adversaries, and that the arrangement would never happen.\\n\\nTwo other friends of Khashoggi said that at least twice he received cordial phone calls from Qahtani, the adviser to the prince, conveying friendly messages on his behalf.\\n\\nIn one of the calls, in September 2017, Qahtani said that Mohammed had been \\\"very happy\\\" to see Khashoggi post a message praising the kingdom after the government announced it was lifting a driving ban on women, according to one of the friends, who was with Khashoggi at the time. The tone of the call was pleasant, but Khashoggi also told Qahtani he would praise the government when there were \\\"positive developments. When there are bad things, I will speak up.\\\"\\n\\nHe spent the rest of the call advocating on behalf of several recently imprisoned critics of the regime.\\n\\nA friend also said that Khashoggi told him he had been approached several times by a businessman close to the Saudi ruling family. The businessman, whom Khashoggi did not name, seemed \\\"keen\\\" to see him every time he visited Washington and told Khashoggi that he would work with the Saudi authorities to arrange his return, the friend said.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington, D.C.\"","lat":38,"lng":-77,"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8edd"},"title":"\"astrea™ Launches Innovative Water Bottle with Subscription Platform for Filter Delivery\"","body":"\"SEATTLE, Oct. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Clean water innovator HaloSource Corporation (\\\"HaloSource\\\" or the \\\"Company\\\") announced today the launch of its innovative filtering water bottle and filter replacement subscription service on astreawater.com. The astrea™ ONE bottle is the first and only filtering bottle to be certified by the Water Quality Association (WQA) for the reduction of lead and other common contaminants that can be found in tap water. Official certification was announced on 2 October 2018 and certification documents can be viewed on the WQA website here.\\n\\nIn support of the bottle launch, the Company is unveiling its new astrea website, a platform designed to enable consumers sign up for subscription plans that ship the replacement filters directly to their homes.\\n\\nThe launch of the astrea™ ONE bottle is a major step forward for HaloSource as it gives the Company a \\\"one of a kind\\\" product that offers critical and relevant benefits (like lead reduction) to consumers in the US, the largest filtered water market in the world. The Company successfully launched the filtering bottle concept on crowdfund platform Indiegogo earlier this year and is now selling the astrea™ ONE bottle with filter subscription plans on astreawater.com.\\n\\nHaloSource CEO James Thompson commented, \\\"Because of the aging infrastructure and the state of water quality in the US, we believe that all reusable water bottles should have a filter. Lead in water is not just a Flint, Michigan problem. It is showing up in homes in Chicago, schools in Detroit and in other cities across America and as a parent, it is really concerning. With this launch, we are providing families with the first mobile solution that helps solve the very serious problem of contamination of our drinking water with lead and other heavy metals. Never before has a portable solution existed that offers the certified performance of our astrea bottle and filters, and we also are making it easy for consumers to maintain that performance by shipping the replacement filters straight to their door. We see the astrea ONE as the next generation reusable bottle because other bottles are only as good as the water put in them, but our bottle will give users confidence in the water they drink from it.\\\"\\n\\nThe Bottle\\n\\nThe astrea™ brand team used market research, personal experience with filtering bottles and consumer feedback to ensure that the innovative reusable water bottle has features that make it easy for its customers to use. \\\"Most filtering bottles on the market today were designed for camping and backpacking. They offer little protection from common contaminants found in tap water and they are not always easy to drink from,\\\" said astrea™ General Manager Greg LaFata. \\\"From the start, our product team set out to design the first everyday filtering water bottle that could make the water taste great, offer real protection from common tap water contaminants and be easy to drink from. Because our customers will use this bottle everyday, we obsessed over the details and included many features that would make it easy to use and easy to maintain its certified performance, and that's why offering filter subscription plans was important to the product offering from the start.\\\"\\n\\nThe 20oz astrea™ ONE bottle (15oz capacity with filter installed) is made from 18/8 kitchen-grade stainless steel, has a seamless interior that makes it easy to clean and double-wall construction that insulates the bottle, keeping water cold for up to 12 hours. The exterior of the bottle has a durable \\\"no sweat\\\" powder-coating and all parts are BPA-free. The bottle makes staying hydrated easy through a number of innovative features, including a patent-pending fill-through lid and easy-sip straw. The fill-through lid enables users to fill the bottle without having to take the lid off, a major consumer pain point identified by the team in its product development process. The easy-sip straw is covered with a soft, food-grade coating and stows in the lid when not in use, offering an additional level of spill protection. When you drink from the straw, the water is filtered as you drink, so there is no wait time for filtered water.\\n\\nThe Filter\\n\\nThe astrea™ ONE uses a high-performance media invented by the Company's team of water scientists and it is the first bottle to earn the NSF53 certification for the reduction of lead, copper, cadmium, mercury, trivalent chromium and benzene, as well as the NSF42 certification for the reduction of chlorine and zinc from the WQA. Each filter is certified to filter 80L (approximately 20 gallons) of water which lasts about two months with average use. A color-coordinated filter change reminder is located on the straw to ensure that users know when they should expect to change the filter and receive a filter in the mail if they are on the monthly subscription plan. Using the astrea™ ONE to get filtered water is about 1/10 the cost of bottled water and each filter saves up to 160 plastic water bottles from being thrown away.\\n\\nSubscription Plans\\n\\nHaloSource is now offering two basic subscription plans on astreawater.com, a month-to-month plan and an annual plan. Users signed up for the month-to-month plan will be billed $12 upon shipment of their replacement filter every two months.\\n\\nThe annual subscription costs $60 a year ($10/filter) and the Company will mail all six replacement filters for the year in one shipment. In the case of both plans, the user is in control of the subscription and can pause or cancel at any time. While enrolled in the plan, all cartridge deliveries are eligible for free shipping. \\\"We know people are busy and everyone with a filtering refrigerator has a story about never changing their filter because it's a pain to find the right one and they don't have time to figure it out,\\\" said Justin Howard Director of E-Commerce. \\\"With astrea, we see the the delivery of filters directly to our customers' homes as an integrated part of our product offering and a convenience for our customers. We don't want them to lose the certified performance of their bottle because they didn't have a filter on-hand when they needed it. In addition to the filter delivery, our customers can also receive notifications for filter replacement, access to special offers and exclusive perks. We think clean, great tasting water everywhere you go for as little as $5/month is a great value.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to selling on its own site, the Company also expects the bottles to be available in all Sur La Table stores nationwide, on surlatable.com, and on amazon.com within the next few weeks.\\n\\nHaloSource Corporation innovates and integrates technologies to deliver clean drinking water solutions to partners with trusted brands around the world. The Company works with scientists and industry experts across the globe in search of new ways to improve drinking water quality and has been awarded more than 30 patents for its ground-breaking chemistries, which provide safe drinking water for millions of consumers globally. The Company's class-leading HaloPure® Drinking Water technology has the highest global certifications, including registration with the US EPA.\\n\\nFounded in Seattle, Washington, HaloSource has grown to become an influential leader in drinking water purification.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8eeb"},"title":"\"West Texas an 'extraction colony' as oil, gas exports surge\"","body":"\"MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Drilling booms have come and gone in this oil town for nearly a century. But the frenzy gripping it now is different. Overwhelming. Drilling rigs tower over suburban backyards. There's a housing crunch so severe that rents are up 30 percent in the last year alone.\\n\\nThis boom is engulfing the rest of West Texas, extending to areas that drilling hasn't touched before. As communities welcome new jobs and business, they're struggling with an onslaught of problems from spikes in traffic accidents to student homelessness.\\n\\nWhat's happening is unprecedented. In December, companies in the Permian Basin -- an ancient, oil-rich seabed that spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico -- produced twice as much oil as they had four years earlier, during the last boom. Forecasters expect production to double again by 2023.\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and others say the drilling spree is ushering in a new era of American energy independence, but American demand isn't driving it. Foreign demand is.\\n\\nIn late 2015, Congress cut a deal to lift 40-year-old restrictions on the export of crude oil. Three years later, the U.S. has surpassed Russia as the world's top oil producer. The International Energy Agency predicts that American oil -- mostly from the Permian -- will account for 80 percent of the growth in global supply through 2025. That's good for corporate profits but bad for air quality in places with heavy drilling. It also threatens to exacerbate climate change.\\n\\n__\\n\\nThis story is part of a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Texas Tribune, The Associated Press and Newsy.\\n\\n__\\n\\nHydraulic fracturing -- better known as fracking -- made this boom technologically possible, but exports are the reason there's so much new drilling. U.S. refineries built for heavier varieties of oil than the Permian produces can't handle the enormous new quantities of Texas light crude. Instead, companies are shipping it abroad.\\n\\nThe lifting of export restrictions \\\"is tantamount to one of the most important things that's ever been done for the industry,\\\" said Tim Dove, chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources, based near Dallas.\\n\\nBut the country is not \\\"energy independent\\\" in the way most Americans would conceive of the idea. Nor can anyone promise that America, as Abbott put it in a recent tweet, \\\"will NEVER AGAIN depend on Foreign Oil Cartels for energy.\\\"\\n\\nThat's because the U.S. is still importing oil: 1.4 billion barrels in the first half of this year alone, a third of it from the foreign oil cartel known as OPEC.\\n\\nThe country will keep buying oil from other nations indefinitely even as it sells more abroad, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts.\\n\\nThe Texas Tribune and the Center for Public Integrity investigated the scope and impacts of energy exports as part of a collaboration with Newsy and The Associated Press.\\n\\nIn Texas, the boom is sending a lot of money into state and local coffers. Oil and gas tax revenue is up more than 50 percent this year. Said James LeBas, a Texas Oil and Gas Association economist: \\\"When oil and gas is doing well, the state is doing well.\\\"\\n\\nStill, climbing production hasn't boosted local tax revenues fast enough to address the problems that come with it, from crowded classrooms to wrecked roads. Schools, police departments and hospitals are struggling to keep employees lured by better-paying oilfield jobs.\\n\\nTexas regulators, long criticized for being too industry-friendly, also aren't aggressively tracking or policing problems that accompany the boom. For example, the Texas portion of the Permian -- roughly the size of Georgia -- has only a few air pollution monitoring stations, leaving residents largely in the dark about what's in the air they breathe.\\n\\nAnd the industry is consuming water in an arid region at an unsustainable rate. Permian Basin operators used eight times as much water to frack and drill last year as they did in 2011.\\n\\nPeople with no say in these decisions are stuck with the consequences, said Coyne Gibson, who lives in a part of the Permian that had little oil and gas activity until a few years ago.\\n\\n\\\"The bitter, cynical way to look at this is, West Texas becomes an extraction colony for the fuel resources for the rest of the world,\\\" said Gibson, a Big Bend Conservation Alliance volunteer who once worked in the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nGlobally, there are major trade-offs, too. Scientists warn this drilling rush almost certainly will worsen climate change by increasing the world's fossil fuel use at a fraught time. They say drastic reductions in greenhouse gases are needed to avoid intensifying climate-linked disasters.\\n\\nTwo massive wildfires in California this summer were among the largest in state history. Record-high temperatures in Japan killed more than 100 people in July. September's Hurricane Florence was the most devastating storm ever to hit the Carolinas, while Texas communities are still struggling to recover from Hurricane Harvey, which shattered U.S. rainfall records last year.\\n\\n\\\"Every additional gigaton of carbon that we produce as a global society carries with it a very real cost,\\\" said Katharine Hayhoe, who directs the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University.\\n\\nMeanwhile, companies are building oil and gas infrastructure meant to last decades -- including more than 8,000 miles of pipeline in Texas alone, enough to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific three times over.\\n\\nThe new infrastructure makes it \\\"very unlikely that we can dramatically curtail fossil fuel use,\\\" said Richard York, an environmental studies and sociology professor at the University of Oregon.\\n\\nThe headaches come almost every day. Some mornings Suzanne Franklin wakes with a nose full of dried blood, her voice filled with gravel. Her husband Jim suffers from respiratory problems, too.\\n\\nWhen Franklin moved to Reeves County in 2010, this remote area roughly 100 miles southwest of Midland was a modest oil and gas producer by Texas standards. Now it ranks third in the state for both. Oil production in the county -- which has fewer than 16,000 residents and more land than Delaware -- skyrocketed from 1.6 million barrels in 2010 to more than 60 million last year, the biggest upturn in the Permian.\\n\\nA sign near one of the new wells, less than a mile from the Franklins, warns of the presence of hydrogen sulfide, a contaminant in crude oil and natural gas. In high concentrations it can kill almost instantly; at low levels it can cause chronic illness.\\n\\nA chemical stench hangs in the air here.\\n\\n\\\"When we went past that site yesterday, I could not believe how bad it was,\\\" Suzanne Franklin said in April. \\\"I just had to stop breathing.\\\"\\n\\nComplaints like hers are common among people who live near gas sites, academic research has found. Flares burning off gas spew pollutants that assault the respiratory system.\\n\\nSites flaring natural gas -- a fossil fuel hitchhiker that comes up with the oil here -- are everywhere in the region. From 2016 through May of this year, the Texas Railroad Commission -- which oversees oil and gas production, not railroads -- issued more than 6,300 permits allowing companies to flare in the Permian, compared to 571 in the entire state from 2008 through 2010.\\n\\nRailroad Commission Chairman Christi Craddick thinks the flaring is a shame -- a waste -- but not an urgent reason for a regulatory crackdown. She called the rules sufficient and well-enforced, adding: \\\"Certainty in regulation is important for industry.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to flaring, oil and gas sites release pollutants during \\\"air emission events\\\" -- pollution releases they characterize as unforeseeable, prompted by equipment malfunctions or other problems. If the state agrees they were unavoidable -- and it almost always does -- they don't count against limits established in state permits that companies must obtain.\\n\\n\\\"These are off-the-books -- they're not levels that are authorized in their air pollution permits, but they're happening routinely,\\\" said Ilan Levin, associate director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a research and advocacy group.\\n\\nLast year, businesses in Texas counties atop the Permian reported pumping out 77,000 tons of pollutants during emission events, largely carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. A single gas processing facility in Pecos County reported 103 such events over the 16 months ending in April, or one every five days.\\n\\nYet punishment is rare. A 2017 investigation by The Texas Tribune found that the agency that regulates air pollution, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, hardly ever fines companies when they bust air permit limits. And only four air pollution monitors are stationed in producing areas of the Texas Permian.\\n\\nThe commission said its monitoring and enforcement comply with state and federal law.\\n\\n\\\"Any violations that are documented during TCEQ investigations are addressed using standard agency protocols and are handled consistently statewide,\\\" the agency said in a written statement. It declined to make officials available for interviews.\\n\\nBalmorhea, population 550, has never been an oil-and-gas hub. It's a tourist destination, thanks to its namesake state park that draws more than 200,000 visitors a year to enjoy the world's largest spring-fed swimming pool -- an acre-plus expanse of blue-green water that pops amid the desert landscape.\\n\\nBut now producers have come for the fossil fuels. Two years ago, Houston-based Apache Corporation announced it had discovered vast oil and gas deposits in the area and leased more than 300,000 acres.\\n\\nWorries about the ancient springs that feed the pool and supply water to Balmorhea and nearby Toyahvale prompted the TCEQ to install a water quality monitoring station in the state park and spawned at least five studies. Apache contributed money for three of them.\\n\\n\\\"We spent considerable time and effort conducting baseline air, water and soil studies and cultural, historical and surface impact assessments before development began,\\\" Apache spokeswoman Castlen Kennedy said in a written statement.\\n\\nThe company promised not to drill within the city limits or the state park, but it isn't waiting for the results of all the studies to exploit its new oil and gas play, known as Alpine High. It plans to drill 5,000 wells in the coming decades.\\n\\nContamination isn't the only water fear. Some worry the industry will use too much in a region already struggling with drought.\\n\\nOil and gas companies consumed nearly 58 billion gallons to frack and drill last year in the entire basin, the consulting firm IHS Markit estimated, far outstripping the 6.8 billion used in 2011. By 2023, that's expected to jump to nearly 130 billion gallons -- 19 times the amount of water Midland used last year.\\n\\nThere isn't a state agency policing groundwater use. That's left to local conservation districts with differing opinions about how much to limit water withdrawals or even whether, in cases involving oil and gas, they have any authority to regulate.\\n\\nAnd substantial parts of West Texas don't have a district: Legally, people in those areas can pull as much water from their property as they can pump.\\n\\nThe consequences of the increased water use are unclear: Major data gaps hinder such investigations, said Bridget Scanlon, a senior research scientist for the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology. For example, the state doesn't require companies to divulge the type of water they're using -- such as fresh or brackish -- for their drilling operations.\\n\\nA 2017 study by researchers at the University of Texas found that more than enough contaminated water, known as \\\"produced water,\\\" was flowing up from oil and gas wells to meet industry demand -- if it had been recycled. Instead, most producers inject it into underground disposal wells, which have been linked to earthquakes.\\n\\nSome Permian producers are now recycling. Apache says it's already reusing 80 percent of its produced water in Alpine High and is aiming for 100 percent.\\n\\nBut the state doesn't require recycling. The Railroad Commission merely tweaked its rules to make the practice easier.\\n\\n\\\"I call it the carrot -?not the stick -?approach,\\\" said Craddick, the commission's chairman. \\\"Water protection and, frankly, protecting the environment is a priority for us.\\\"\\n\\nToyahvale resident Neta Rhyne thinks that's a complete misrepresentation.\\n\\n\\\"Why are they destroying our beautiful desert oasis to send oil to Asia?\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe superintendent of Ector County's school district teared up this spring as he talked about problems that have come with the oil boom.\\n\\nStudent enrollment has doubled in six years. Classrooms are overcrowded. Staffers keep leaving for oilfield jobs; the district is a few hundred teachers short and new hires can't find anywhere they can afford to live. Homelessness among students spiked 26 percent last academic year, with more than 2,100 living in shelters, doubling up with other families or otherwise displaced as housing costs outpace wages.\\n\\n\\\"The thing that really keeps me up at night is, are we giving the kids everything they deserve?\\\" then-Superintendent Tom Crowe said in an April interview, a few months before he retired. \\\"I get emotional about it. I've been doing this a long time and every day I worry, is there a kid out there who slips through the cracks?\\\"\\n\\nThe boom is straining communities across the Permian. Midland County has seen rents rise so fast -- 65 percent since 2010 -- that it's now the most expensive place to lease a home in the state, with Ector County close behind, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development figures.\\n\\nThen there's the traffic -- outright frightening in some places as heavy trucks have multiplied. In Winkler County, population 7,600, accidents are up more than 70 percent this year.\\n\\nOil-related traffic is also chewing up pavement on roads and bridges that weren't designed to carry such heavy loads. Texas Department of Transportation data show the increase in traffic brought by the boom has damaged more than 3,000 miles of state highways in Permian counties. The agency has $3.4 billion worth of projects planned for the area over the next decade -- an investment it describes as \\\"historic\\\" -- but, as of the end of July, it estimated that it still needs more than $1.1 billion for repair work and safety upgrades.\\n\\nOil and gas companies, along with firms that serve them, have responded by paying for some road safety projects and providing housing for their workers.\\n\\nAs they confront the boom's downsides, local leaders across the Permian must make educated guesses about the best ways to respond, laying their bets on how much Permian oil and gas the world will snap up -- and for how long.\\n\\nCraddick, the Railroad Commission chairman who grew up in Midland, said no one can predict a boom's duration, but \\\"I don't think that this is going away in a generation or more.\\\"\\n\\nThe city at the center of the export boom is trying to settle in for the long haul. Leaders have choices to make -- uncomfortable ones.\\n\\nIn April, Midland City Council members looked tortured as they discussed a new drainage fee based on how much concrete covers a property -- common in Texas but anathema to this conservative stronghold -- so they could pay for basic city services.\\n\\nThey reluctantly voted in favor.\\n\\nDefending the decision, council member Scott Dufford put into words the fear of every town strapped to a rocket it can't steer, powered by companies selling Permian crude to the world: \\\"If we do nothing, we're going to be in even more trouble in 10 years.\\\"\\n\\n__\\n\\nTexas Tribune journalists Brandon Formby and Chris Essig, and Center for Public Integrity news developer Pratheek Rebala contributed to this article.\\n\\nCopyright © The Associated Press.

States including California outlawed cadmium in children's jewelry, and testing by the center found the chemical had virtually disappeared from jewelry by 2012.\\n\\nNo laws address cadmium in adult jewelry, however, and last year the center decided to check those products. Lab testing found 31 adult jewelry items purchased from retail stores were at least 40 percent cadmium, and most were more than 90 percent, according to results shared exclusively with the AP.\\n\\nCalifornia's law allows no more than 0.03 percent cadmium in children's jewelry. The precise health risk from the tested jewelry is unclear because researchers did not assess whether small amounts shed when the jewelry is handled and worn.\\n\\nOver time, cadmium accumulates in the body and can damage the kidneys and bones. Most exposure happens by ingesting small amounts or by breathing it, most commonly through tobacco, which can contain cadmium. Researchers also have documented some absorption through skin contact, though the phenomenon is not well-studied.\\n\\nMichael Harbut, a practicing doctor who as a university professor has researched cadmium's cancer-causing properties, noted that contact can trigger skin rashes including psoriasis.\\n\\n\\\"Cadmium is bad,\\\" said Harbut, who teaches at Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine. \\\"Given a choice between wearing something with cadmium in it, or wearing something without cadmium in it, I would take the product without cadmium.\\\"\\n\\nThe Oakland-based nonprofit bought all the test samples in the San Francisco Bay Area this year or last. The extent to which contaminated jewelry is in stores elsewhere isn't clear, though a national retailer would not typically limit a product to just one region.\\n\\nThe center said the problem should not be underestimated because of the limited market sampling.\\n\\n\\\"If you're the person that buys and is wearing that jewelry, you don't really care whether it's a common problem or a rare problem,\\\" said Caroline Cox, senior scientist at the center. \\\"You have a problem.\\\"\\n\\nBrent Cleaveland, executive director of the Fashion Jewelry and Accessories Trade Association, said he does not believe the test results suggest a larger problem. Most major retailers have a stringent system for testing and analyzing what they sell, he said.\\n\\nMost of the tainted items were sold at Ross, which operates more than 1,400 stores in 38 states. One pendant from a necklace chain was 100 percent cadmium, according to the testing.\\n\\nIn a written statement, Ross said it is committed to protecting its customers and has \\\"addressed this issue with our supplier.\\\" The retailer would not say whether it pulled suspect jewelry from stores.\\n\\nThe brands found with high cadmium levels in Ross stores include Tacera and Vibe Sportswear.\\n\\nXinwei Xie, chief executive officer at Trend Textile Inc., which owns Tacera, declined to comment when reached by phone. The Skate Group Inc., which owns Vibe Sportswear, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\\n\\nPapaya said it considers cadmium in its products a serious problem. It operates more than 100 retail locations nationwide.\\n\\nSteven Kim, an attorney representing Papaya, said the company has recalled the products where contamination was found and stopped buying from the manufacturer in China.\\n\\n\\\"Our manufacturers are required to represent and warrant that their products are in legal compliance,\\\" Kim said. \\\"Papaya is very strict and stops doing business with any manufacturer which fails to comply.\\\"\\n\\nNordstrom spokeswoman Emily Sterken said the company is \\\"reaching out to these vendors to make them aware of the situation and get more information on these items.\\\"\\n\\nThe Center for Environmental Health has long used California law to force companies to reduce levels of harmful materials in consumer products, including cadmium and lead in jewelry.\\n\\nUnder the state's Proposition 65, businesses must inform consumers about significant exposures to chemicals that cause cancer or other reproductive harm. The nonprofit has settled Proposition 65 claims against 36 companies, including Gap Inc. and Target Corp., which agreed to not sell jewelry with more than 0.03 percent cadmium.\\n\\nThat limit for children's jewelry took effect after the AP reported in 2010 that some Chinese jewelry manufacturers were substituting cadmium for lead, the use of which Congress clamped down on following a string of imported-product safety scandals.\\n\\nThe jewelry industry helped write voluntary U.S. standards following the AP investigation, but the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission did not mandate any cadmium limits.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Los Angeles\"","lat":34,"lng":-118,"__v":0}

For the 12 months ending in September, consumer prices were up 2.3%.\\n\\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.1% in September, the same level as in August. It is up 2.2% over the past year.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times this year and signaled that it will raise rates one more time in 2018 in an effort to make sure that a strong economy and low unemployment do not trigger an unwanted rise in inflation. The jobless rate fell to a 49-year low of 3.7% in September.\\n\\nBut President Donald Trump has stepped up his criticism of the Fed's rate hikes, calling them unwarranted. Rising interest rates were one of the factors blamed for the big sell-off on Wall Street this week.\\n\\nTrump, who has often pointed to the stock market surge as evidence that his economic policies are working, said Oct. 10 that the Fed had \\\"gone crazy\\\" raising short-term interest rates.\\n\\n\\\"The Fed is making a mistake.

One group was as large as 275 people.\\n\\n\\\"We've seen large groups in the past, but never on this scale,\\\" Tucson-based Border Patrol Agent Daniel Hernandez said. \\\"It's definitely a serious concern because their safety is being put in jeopardy.\\\"\\n\\nHernandez said the latest case involved 61 people rescued by agents last week from rising floodwaters caused by unusually heavy rains in an isolated area and \\\"it could have been a much, much worse situation if the rain continued.\\\"\\n\\nUnlike Texas, where people turn themselves in on the banks of the Rio Grande, the smugglers in in Arizona have been dumping groups of migrant families on a remote dirt road running along the southern limit of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument west of the Lukeville border crossing with Mexico.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8efd"},"title":"\"West Texas an 'extraction colony' as oil, gas exports surge | WTOP\"","body":"\"MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Drilling booms have come and gone in this oil town for nearly a century. But the frenzy gripping it now is different. Overwhelming. Drilling rigs tower over suburban backyards. There's a housing crunch so severe that rents are up 30 percent in the last year alone.\\n\\nThis boom is engulfing the rest of West Texas, extending to areas that drilling hasn't touched before. As communities welcome new jobs and business, they're struggling with an onslaught of problems from spikes in traffic accidents to student homelessness.\\n\\nWhat's happening is unprecedented. In December, companies in the Permian Basin -- an ancient, oil-rich seabed that spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico -- produced twice as much oil as they had four years earlier, during the last boom. Forecasters expect production to double again by 2023.\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and others say the drilling spree is ushering in a new era of American energy independence, but American demand isn't driving it. Foreign demand is.\\n\\nIn late 2015, Congress cut a deal to lift 40-year-old restrictions on the export of crude oil. Three years later, the U.S. has surpassed Russia as the world's top oil producer. The International Energy Agency predicts that American oil -- mostly from the Permian -- will account for 80 percent of the growth in global supply through 2025. That's good for corporate profits but bad for air quality in places with heavy drilling. It also threatens to exacerbate climate change.\\n\\n__\\n\\nThis story is part of a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Texas Tribune, The Associated Press and Newsy.\\n\\n__\\n\\nHydraulic fracturing -- better known as fracking -- made this boom technologically possible, but exports are the reason there's so much new drilling. U.S. refineries built for heavier varieties of oil than the Permian produces can't handle the enormous new quantities of Texas light crude. Instead, companies are shipping it abroad.\\n\\nThe lifting of export restrictions \\\"is tantamount to one of the most important things that's ever been done for the industry,\\\" said Tim Dove, chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources, based near Dallas.\\n\\nBut the country is not \\\"energy independent\\\" in the way most Americans would conceive of the idea. Nor can anyone promise that America, as Abbott put it in a recent tweet, \\\"will NEVER AGAIN depend on Foreign Oil Cartels for energy.\\\"\\n\\nThat's because the U.S. is still importing oil: 1.4 billion barrels in the first half of this year alone, a third of it from the foreign oil cartel known as OPEC.\\n\\nThe country will keep buying oil from other nations indefinitely even as it sells more abroad, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts.\\n\\nThe Texas Tribune and the Center for Public Integrity investigated the scope and impacts of energy exports as part of a collaboration with Newsy and The Associated Press.\\n\\nIn Texas, the boom is sending a lot of money into state and local coffers. Oil and gas tax revenue is up more than 50 percent this year. Said James LeBas, a Texas Oil and Gas Association economist: \\\"When oil and gas is doing well, the state is doing well.\\\"\\n\\nStill, climbing production hasn't boosted local tax revenues fast enough to address the problems that come with it, from crowded classrooms to wrecked roads. Schools, police departments and hospitals are struggling to keep employees lured by better-paying oilfield jobs.\\n\\nTexas regulators, long criticized for being too industry-friendly, also aren't aggressively tracking or policing problems that accompany the boom. For example, the Texas portion of the Permian -- roughly the size of Georgia -- has only a few air pollution monitoring stations, leaving residents largely in the dark about what's in the air they breathe.\\n\\nAnd the industry is consuming water in an arid region at an unsustainable rate. Permian Basin operators used eight times as much water to frack and drill last year as they did in 2011.\\n\\nPeople with no say in these decisions are stuck with the consequences, said Coyne Gibson, who lives in a part of the Permian that had little oil and gas activity until a few years ago.\\n\\n\\\"The bitter, cynical way to look at this is, West Texas becomes an extraction colony for the fuel resources for the rest of the world,\\\" said Gibson, a Big Bend Conservation Alliance volunteer who once worked in the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nGlobally, there are major trade-offs, too. Scientists warn this drilling rush almost certainly will worsen climate change by increasing the world's fossil fuel use at a fraught time. They say drastic reductions in greenhouse gases are needed to avoid intensifying climate-linked disasters.\\n\\nTwo massive wildfires in California this summer were among the largest in state history. Record-high temperatures in Japan killed more than 100 people in July. September's Hurricane Florence was the most devastating storm ever to hit the Carolinas, while Texas communities are still struggling to recover from Hurricane Harvey, which shattered U.S. rainfall records last year.\\n\\n\\\"Every additional gigaton of carbon that we produce as a global society carries with it a very real cost,\\\" said Katharine Hayhoe, who directs the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University.\\n\\nMeanwhile, companies are building oil and gas infrastructure meant to last decades -- including more than 8,000 miles of pipeline in Texas alone, enough to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific three times over.\\n\\nThe new infrastructure makes it \\\"very unlikely that we can dramatically curtail fossil fuel use,\\\" said Richard York, an environmental studies and sociology professor at the University of Oregon.\\n\\nThe headaches come almost every day. Some mornings Suzanne Franklin wakes with a nose full of dried blood, her voice filled with gravel. Her husband Jim suffers from respiratory problems, too.\\n\\nWhen Franklin moved to Reeves County in 2010, this remote area roughly 100 miles southwest of Midland was a modest oil and gas producer by Texas standards. Now it ranks third in the state for both. Oil production in the county -- which has fewer than 16,000 residents and more land than Delaware -- skyrocketed from 1.6 million barrels in 2010 to more than 60 million last year, the biggest upturn in the Permian.\\n\\nA sign near one of the new wells, less than a mile from the Franklins, warns of the presence of hydrogen sulfide, a contaminant in crude oil and natural gas. In high concentrations it can kill almost instantly; at low levels it can cause chronic illness.\\n\\nA chemical stench hangs in the air here.\\n\\n\\\"When we went past that site yesterday, I could not believe how bad it was,\\\" Suzanne Franklin said in April. \\\"I just had to stop breathing.\\\"\\n\\nComplaints like hers are common among people who live near gas sites, academic research has found. Flares burning off gas spew pollutants that assault the respiratory system.\\n\\nSites flaring natural gas -- a fossil fuel hitchhiker that comes up with the oil here -- are everywhere in the region. From 2016 through May of this year, the Texas Railroad Commission -- which oversees oil and gas production, not railroads -- issued more than 6,300 permits allowing companies to flare in the Permian, compared to 571 in the entire state from 2008 through 2010.\\n\\nRailroad Commission Chairman Christi Craddick thinks the flaring is a shame -- a waste -- but not an urgent reason for a regulatory crackdown. She called the rules sufficient and well-enforced, adding: \\\"Certainty in regulation is important for industry.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to flaring, oil and gas sites release pollutants during \\\"air emission events\\\" -- pollution releases they characterize as unforeseeable, prompted by equipment malfunctions or other problems. If the state agrees they were unavoidable -- and it almost always does -- they don't count against limits established in state permits that companies must obtain.\\n\\n\\\"These are off-the-books -- they're not levels that are authorized in their air pollution permits, but they're happening routinely,\\\" said Ilan Levin, associate director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a research and advocacy group.\\n\\nLast year, businesses in Texas counties atop the Permian reported pumping out 77,000 tons of pollutants during emission events, largely carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. A single gas processing facility in Pecos County reported 103 such events over the 16 months ending in April, or one every five days.\\n\\nYet punishment is rare. A 2017 investigation by The Texas Tribune found that the agency that regulates air pollution, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, hardly ever fines companies when they bust air permit limits. And only four air pollution monitors are stationed in producing areas of the Texas Permian.\\n\\nThe commission said its monitoring and enforcement comply with state and federal law.\\n\\n\\\"Any violations that are documented during TCEQ investigations are addressed using standard agency protocols and are handled consistently statewide,\\\" the agency said in a written statement. It declined to make officials available for interviews.\\n\\nBalmorhea, population 550, has never been an oil-and-gas hub. It's a tourist destination, thanks to its namesake state park that draws more than 200,000 visitors a year to enjoy the world's largest spring-fed swimming pool -- an acre-plus expanse of blue-green water that pops amid the desert landscape.\\n\\nBut now producers have come for the fossil fuels. Two years ago, Houston-based Apache Corporation announced it had discovered vast oil and gas deposits in the area and leased more than 300,000 acres.\\n\\nWorries about the ancient springs that feed the pool and supply water to Balmorhea and nearby Toyahvale prompted the TCEQ to install a water quality monitoring station in the state park and spawned at least five studies. Apache contributed money for three of them.\\n\\n\\\"We spent considerable time and effort conducting baseline air, water and soil studies and cultural, historical and surface impact assessments before development began,\\\" Apache spokeswoman Castlen Kennedy said in a written statement.\\n\\nThe company promised not to drill within the city limits or the state park, but it isn't waiting for the results of all the studies to exploit its new oil and gas play, known as Alpine High. It plans to drill 5,000 wells in the coming decades.\\n\\nContamination isn't the only water fear. Some worry the industry will use too much in a region already struggling with drought.\\n\\nOil and gas companies consumed nearly 58 billion gallons to frack and drill last year in the entire basin, the consulting firm IHS Markit estimated, far outstripping the 6.8 billion used in 2011. By 2023, that's expected to jump to nearly 130 billion gallons -- 19 times the amount of water Midland used last year.\\n\\nThere isn't a state agency policing groundwater use. That's left to local conservation districts with differing opinions about how much to limit water withdrawals or even whether, in cases involving oil and gas, they have any authority to regulate.\\n\\nAnd substantial parts of West Texas don't have a district: Legally, people in those areas can pull as much water from their property as they can pump.\\n\\nThe consequences of the increased water use are unclear: Major data gaps hinder such investigations, said Bridget Scanlon, a senior research scientist for the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology. For example, the state doesn't require companies to divulge the type of water they're using -- such as fresh or brackish -- for their drilling operations.\\n\\nA 2017 study by researchers at the University of Texas found that more than enough contaminated water, known as \\\"produced water,\\\" was flowing up from oil and gas wells to meet industry demand -- if it had been recycled. Instead, most producers inject it into underground disposal wells, which have been linked to earthquakes.\\n\\nSome Permian producers are now recycling. Apache says it's already reusing 80 percent of its produced water in Alpine High and is aiming for 100 percent.\\n\\nBut the state doesn't require recycling. The Railroad Commission merely tweaked its rules to make the practice easier.\\n\\n\\\"I call it the carrot -- ?not the stick -- ?approach,\\\" said Craddick, the commission's chairman. \\\"Water protection and, frankly, protecting the environment is a priority for us.\\\"\\n\\nToyahvale resident Neta Rhyne thinks that's a complete misrepresentation.\\n\\n\\\"Why are they destroying our beautiful desert oasis to send oil to Asia?\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe superintendent of Ector County's school district teared up this spring as he talked about problems that have come with the oil boom.\\n\\nStudent enrollment has doubled in six years. Classrooms are overcrowded. Staffers keep leaving for oilfield jobs; the district is a few hundred teachers short and new hires can't find anywhere they can afford to live. Homelessness among students spiked 26 percent last academic year, with more than 2,100 living in shelters, doubling up with other families or otherwise displaced as housing costs outpace wages.\\n\\n\\\"The thing that really keeps me up at night is, are we giving the kids everything they deserve?\\\" then-Superintendent Tom Crowe said in an April interview, a few months before he retired. \\\"I get emotional about it. I've been doing this a long time and every day I worry, is there a kid out there who slips through the cracks?\\\"\\n\\nThe boom is straining communities across the Permian. Midland County has seen rents rise so fast -- 65 percent since 2010 -- that it's now the most expensive place to lease a home in the state, with Ector County close behind, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development figures.\\n\\nThen there's the traffic -- outright frightening in some places as heavy trucks have multiplied. In Winkler County, population 7,600, accidents are up more than 70 percent this year.\\n\\nOil-related traffic is also chewing up pavement on roads and bridges that weren't designed to carry such heavy loads. Texas Department of Transportation data show the increase in traffic brought by the boom has damaged more than 3,000 miles of state highways in Permian counties. The agency has $3.4 billion worth of projects planned for the area over the next decade -- an investment it describes as \\\"historic\\\" -- but, as of the end of July, it estimated that it still needs more than $1.1 billion for repair work and safety upgrades.\\n\\nOil and gas companies, along with firms that serve them, have responded by paying for some road safety projects and providing housing for their workers.\\n\\nAs they confront the boom's downsides, local leaders across the Permian must make educated guesses about the best ways to respond, laying their bets on how much Permian oil and gas the world will snap up -- and for how long.\\n\\nCraddick, the Railroad Commission chairman who grew up in Midland, said no one can predict a boom's duration, but \\\"I don't think that this is going away in a generation or more.\\\"\\n\\nThe city at the center of the export boom is trying to settle in for the long haul. Leaders have choices to make -- uncomfortable ones.\\n\\nIn April, Midland City Council members looked tortured as they discussed a new drainage fee based on how much concrete covers a property -- common in Texas but anathema to this conservative stronghold -- so they could pay for basic city services.\\n\\nThey reluctantly voted in favor.\\n\\nDefending the decision, council member Scott Dufford put into words the fear of every town strapped to a rocket it can't steer, powered by companies selling Permian crude to the world: \\\"If we do nothing, we're going to be in even more trouble in 10 years.\\\"\\n\\n__\\n\\nTexas Tribune journalists Brandon Formby and Chris Essig, and Center for Public Integrity news developer Pratheek Rebala contributed to this article.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

One group was as large as 275 people.\\n\\n\\\"We've seen large groups in the past, but never on this scale,\\\" Tucson-based Border Patrol Agent Daniel Hernandez said. \\\"It's definitely a serious concern because their safety is being put in jeopardy.\\\"\\n\\nHernandez said the latest case involved 61 people rescued by agents last week from rising floodwaters caused by unusually heavy rains in an isolated area and \\\"it could have been a much, much worse situation if the rain continued.\\\"\\n\\nUnlike Texas, where people turn themselves in on the banks of the Rio Grande, the smugglers in in Arizona have been dumping groups of migrant families on a remote dirt road running along the southern limit of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument west of the Lukeville border crossing with Mexico. Summer temperatures there can soar close to 120 degrees (49 Celsius).\\n\\nThe migrants are sometimes provided with food and water, but not always, and they often require medical care for back and ankle injuries or lacerations.\\n\\nThe traffickers have \\\"no regard for the safety and well-being of these families,\\\" Tucson Sector Chief Rodolfo Karisch said last week.\\n\\nTwo larger groups of migrants from Guatemala and Honduras were also found abandoned last week near Yuma. Border Patrol officers said 108 people were found just before midnight Oct. 2 a half-mile west of the San Luis Port of Entry and five hours later, agents apprehended 56 Central Americans a mile east of the same border crossing.\\n\\nWhile Mexican men traveling without relatives once made up the bulk of the migrants, Guatemalans and other Central Americans traveling in families or as unaccompanied minors are now the norm.\\n\\nU.S. Immigration and Control Enforcement in Arizona began releasing hundreds of people Sunday to await court dates, saying it didn't have the capacity to hold an \\\"incredibly high volume\\\" of migrant families showing up at the border.\\n\\nRepublican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona on Wednesday asked Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and other officials to investigate ways of dealing with a wave of migrants he said was overwhelming Yuma and other parts of southern Arizona. He said at a Senate hearing that he worried about people being threatened \\\"by an enormous number of illegal entrants ... some of whom may not be making asylum claims.\\\"\\n\\nNielsen said she didn't know how many of the migrants in southern Arizona had made asylum claims, but would look into it.\\n\\nUnder federal law and international treaties, people can obtain asylum in the U.S. if they have a well-grounded fear of persecution in their countries, but Trump administration officials charge that the system is rife with fraud and groundless claims and have called for stricter standards.\\n\\nAbout eight of every 10 asylum-seekers pass an initial screening and are then either held in an immigration detention center or released on bond into the U.S. while their cases wind through immigration courts. Many claims are ultimately denied.\\n\\nHernandez said the smugglers instructed the migrants to seek asylum or some other kind of U.S. protective status, but interviews have indicated they came to the U.S. to improve their economic situation and were headed to places including Charleston, South Carolina; Oakland, California and Homestead, Florida.\\n\\nAli Noorani, executive director of the Washington advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said the government doesn't have the resources to deal with the wave of migrants and \\\"should use some of that money to address the root causes of poverty and violence in Guatemala and process the asylum cases in a fair manner.\\\"\\n\\nCentral Americans typically cite violence in their homelands when applying for asylum claims. The recently apprehended migrants came from Honduras and El Salvador, which like Guatemala are home to deadly gangs like the MS-13.\\n\\nFrom Oct. 1, 2017 through Aug. 31, nearly double the number of Guatemalans and more than twice as many Salvadorans were arrested compared with the same 11-month period the year before. The most recent statistics from the Customs and Border Protection agency show that apprehensions of people traveling in families and as unaccompanied minors were also way up.\\n\\nOf the more than 90,000 migrants traveling in families who were apprehended during the 11-month period, close to half were from Guatemala.

One of the carport's legs punctured the roof and hit the 11-year-old girl in the head.\\n\\nBrooks said he wasn't able to get out much overnight to fully assess the damage in the county, because downed power lines and trees made roads impassable in the darkness.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8f06"},"title":"\"This Canadian Hockey Star Doubles as a Law Enforcer\"","body":"\"VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- With a full-time job at the Vancouver Police Department, Meghan Agosta could easily have decided to retire from hockey this year, at age 31. Instead Agosta, a star forward on the Canadian national team, remains determined to return for her fifth Winter Olympics, in Beijing in 2022.\\n\\n\\\"We were roommates at the Olympics, and I said to her: 'How does it feel? Is this going to be your last?' \\\" said Laura Fortino, a defender who made the most recent Olympic all-star team at the Pyeongchang Games in February. \\\"She looked at me dead straight in the face and said: 'You know what? I'm not ready. This is not my last.'\\n\\n\\\"Knowing Gus, she is so determined. I know she will come back and play in Beijing.\\\"\\n\\nAgosta, who has three Olympic gold medals, took the last shootout shot in the final against the United States in South Korea. When the American goalie Maddie Rooney stopped the five-hole attempt, it ended Canada's reign as the four-time champion and gave the United States its first title since the inaugural Olympic women's hockey tournament in 1998.\\n\\nDespite her ultracompetitive nature, Agosta handled the defeat with the kind of composure required in her law enforcement career in Vancouver, where she regularly faces life-or-death situations.\\n\\n\\\"I've only been on the job for three and a half years, but I've seen basically everything,\\\" Agosta said. \\\"They say as a police officer, you have a front-row seat to the best show in town. You leave some of the calls and you just shake your head: 'Did that really happen?'\\n\\n\\\"I've been to homicides, suicides, domestic complaints. My mind-set and perspective on life has changed drastically since I've become a police officer. You really have to enjoy the moments you have, especially playing for Team Canada.\\\"\\n\\nAgosta will complete a hat trick of major life challenges in 2018 when she gives birth to her first child, a baby girl, in December. She is already raising two stepsons with Jason Robillard, her fiancé. Robillard is a Vancouver police sergeant.\\n\\n\\\"We're very happy to say that we're starting a family of our own and having a little baby girl,\\\" Agosta said. \\\"Hopefully she'll follow in my footsteps someday!\\\"\\n\\nIt is remarkable that this native of Ruthven, Ontario, was able to make the 2018 Olympic team, and that assessment is not a reflection of her talent. A former Mercyhurst University captain, who graduated with a criminal justice degree and a minor in criminalistics psychology, Agosta is the all-time N.C.A.A. leader in goals (157) and points (303). She won Canadian Women's Hockey League scoring titles with the Montreal Stars in 2012 and 2013.\\n\\nHowever, since Agosta moved to British Columbia in 2014, she has not trained or played with other top female players, except when the national team convenes. The last local professional women's team, the Vancouver Griffins, folded in 2003.\\n\\nAgosta has found alternatives, such as playing for the Vancouver Police Department's team, practicing with a local Midget AAA team of boys ages 15 to 17, and training with a skills coach at the University of British Columbia.\\n\\n\\\"She's always been self-motivated and driven, but I think her true colors came out when she decided to take on this full-time job,\\\" Fortino said. \\\"She's kind of on her own little island there in Vancouver. She has no choice but to find ice and practice her skills and train in the gym by herself.\\\"\\n\\nAgosta, who missed the 2015 International Ice Hockey Federation world championship in Sweden to pursue policing, initially felt trepidation about her bold career move.\\n\\n\\\"I was starting police academy in September 2014,\\\" Agosta said. \\\"I thought, 'Oh man, now I've got to tell Hockey Canada that I need to take the year off.' That was my biggest fear. But Hockey Canada supported me: 'It's not like you're going to go tour the world. We know that this is the career choice you wanted.' I've been very fortunate.\\\"\\n\\nShe has had to sandwich her training between policing shifts, four days off and then four days on. Her shifts vary, typically running 11 or 12 hours and often keeping her up all night. That routine rivals the jet lag she might face when traveling with the national hockey team. Currently, because of her pregnancy, she is working a desk job four days a week with the Vancouver Police Department's major crime section.\\n\\n\\\"Eating, sleeping and training at different times is part of the challenge for me,\\\" Agosta said. \\\"The quote I would use is 'improvise, adapt and overcome.' Just have that belief and the positive mind-set that this is tough, but I still have a lot more to give.\\\"\\n\\nIn her limited recovery time, Agosta's pleasures are simple. She drinks coffee, watches \\\"The Bachelor\\\" and walks her dog, Rocky, with her family in their South Surrey neighborhood.\\n\\nSomehow, it works. Finland's Noora Raty, named the best goalie at the 2018 Olympics, attests to Agosta's prowess.\\n\\n\\\"Meghan is one of the most dangerous players I've ever played against because of her high hockey I.Q.,\\\" Raty said in an email. \\\"She is a constant scoring threat because of her speed, poise with the puck and quick snap shot, which is hard to read as a goalie. She is just a complete, all-around player who can play in all three zones.\\\"\\n\\nAgosta is also a dressing room leader. Recalling her experiences before the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy, she preaches a gratitude-based, go-for-it attitude to her teammates.\\n\\n\\\"I was 18 and our oldest player, Danielle Goyette, was 40,\\\" Agosta said. \\\"I was in awe: 'Holy crow! I'm in the dressing room with all my childhood heroes.' Coach Mel Davidson pulled me aside two months in and said: 'Listen, you're here for a reason. You need to start performing. If not, we're going to have to release you.' I thought, 'I have nothing to lose.' That's when I changed how I was playing.\\\"\\n\\nAgosta, long focused on the rivalry between Canada and the United States, will be unavailable to play for Canada at the 2019 world championship in Espoo, Finland, in April; she should be quite busy with a new baby girl by then.\\n\\nAgosta informed her Canadian teammates via the messaging app WhatsApp that she would sit out the world championship, but she plans to get back in shape for the team's annual fitness testing in May 2019. She continued to hit the gym this summer but stayed off the ice, apart from running her hockey school in Ontario in late August.\\n\\nFor a veteran athlete like Agosta, who chose hockey over figure skating at age 6, international tournaments still represent the pinnacle. The United States has won seven of the last eight world championships. Canada last prevailed in 2012.\\n\\n\\\"It's not about which line you play on or which power-play unit,\\\" Agosta said. \\\"It's about being there and being part of the team. My perspective on hockey has changed, just living in the moment, taking each opportunity and going with it. So many young girls would love to be in this position.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Vancouver\"","lat":49,"lng":-123,"__v":0}

It was thought by many that Oklahoma might be just a detour on George's road home to Los Angeles to play for the Lakers. Instead, Russell Westbrook and the Thunder made a winning sales pitch. George, an All-Star and one of the league's best two-way players, shocked many by staying instead of leaving in free agency.\\n\\n\\\"I just developed these really good relationships here, almost feeling like I've been here for a while,\\\" George said. \\\"And then just over the course of the whole season, it just steamrolled, just got better and better, and here I am.\\\"\\n\\nGeorge's return is fueling hopes that Oklahoma City can improve on a disappointing, inconsistent season that ended with a first-round playoff exit.\\n\\n\\\"I just think we worked through a lot in one year, and people expected us to be a lot further along,\\\" George said. \\\"But honestly, that's the reason why I'm here for year two. I knew it wasn't going to be something that happened in one year being with this group. You've got to build certain habits, and that's the habits we're hoping that we build, is that consistency.\\\"\\n\\nThe Thunder traded Carmelo Anthony during the summer in a deal that brought guard Dennis Schroder from the Atlanta Hawks. Schroder, who averaged 19.4 points and 6.2 assists last season, has been dynamic during the preseason.\\n\\n\\\"Obviously Dennis is a great player,\\\" Westbrook said. \\\"Done a lot of great things in Atlanta. Plays fast, plays with pace, good with the basketball, and I think it's going to open up a lot of different things for him and myself when we're on the floor together, so looking forward to it.\\\"\\n\\nROBERSON'S KNEE\\n\\nThunder guard Andre Roberson, one of the league's top perimeter defenders, will be out for at least two months following a procedure as he recovers from the torn left patellar tendon that cost him the second half of last season. Oklahoma City's defense suffered without him last season, but Schroder could make up for his absence with his athleticism and scoring prowess.\\n\\nMISSING 'MELO\\n\\nGeorge acknowledged that things didn't go as planned with Anthony, who struggled at times last season. Anthony is now with Houston, and Oklahoma City has become younger and faster.\\n\\n\\\"We miss Melo here as a teammate, as a brother, but if something doesn't work, it doesn't work,\\\" George said. \\\"It's nothing that he did, it's nothing that the organization did, nothing that the coaches did.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8f09"},"title":"\"West Texas an 'extraction colony' as oil, gas exports surge\"","body":"\"MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Drilling booms have come and gone in this oil town for nearly a century. But the frenzy gripping it now is different. Overwhelming. Drilling rigs tower over suburban backyards. There's a housing crunch so severe that rents are up 30 percent in the last year alone.\\n\\nThis boom is engulfing the rest of West Texas, extending to areas that drilling hasn't touched before. As communities welcome new jobs and business, they're struggling with an onslaught of problems from spikes in traffic accidents to student homelessness.\\n\\nWhat's happening is unprecedented. In December, companies in the Permian Basin -- an ancient, oil-rich seabed that spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico -- produced twice as much oil as they had four years earlier, during the last boom. Forecasters expect production to double again by 2023.\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and others say the drilling spree is ushering in a new era of American energy independence, but American demand isn't driving it. Foreign demand is.\\n\\nIn late 2015, Congress cut a deal to lift 40-year-old restrictions on the export of crude oil. Three years later, the U.S. has surpassed Russia as the world's top oil producer. The International Energy Agency predicts that American oil -- mostly from the Permian -- will account for 80 percent of the growth in global supply through 2025. That's good for corporate profits but bad for air quality in places with heavy drilling. It also threatens to exacerbate climate change.\\n\\n__\\n\\nThis story is part of a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Texas Tribune, The Associated Press and Newsy.\\n\\n__\\n\\nHydraulic fracturing -- better known as fracking -- made this boom technologically possible, but exports are the reason there's so much new drilling. U.S. refineries built for heavier varieties of oil than the Permian produces can't handle the enormous new quantities of Texas light crude. Instead, companies are shipping it abroad.\\n\\nThe lifting of export restrictions \\\"is tantamount to one of the most important things that's ever been done for the industry,\\\" said Tim Dove, chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources, based near Dallas.\\n\\nBut the country is not \\\"energy independent\\\" in the way most Americans would conceive of the idea. Nor can anyone promise that America, as Abbott put it in a recent tweet, \\\"will NEVER AGAIN depend on Foreign Oil Cartels for energy.\\\"\\n\\nThat's because the U.S. is still importing oil: 1.4 billion barrels in the first half of this year alone, a third of it from the foreign oil cartel known as OPEC.\\n\\nThe country will keep buying oil from other nations indefinitely even as it sells more abroad, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts.\\n\\nThe Texas Tribune and the Center for Public Integrity investigated the scope and impacts of energy exports as part of a collaboration with Newsy and The Associated Press.\\n\\nIn Texas, the boom is sending a lot of money into state and local coffers. Oil and gas tax revenue is up more than 50 percent this year. Said James LeBas, a Texas Oil and Gas Association economist: \\\"When oil and gas is doing well, the state is doing well.\\\"\\n\\nStill, climbing production hasn't boosted local tax revenues fast enough to address the problems that come with it, from crowded classrooms to wrecked roads. Schools, police departments and hospitals are struggling to keep employees lured by better-paying oilfield jobs.\\n\\nTexas regulators, long criticized for being too industry-friendly, also aren't aggressively tracking or policing problems that accompany the boom. For example, the Texas portion of the Permian -- roughly the size of Georgia -- has only a few air pollution monitoring stations, leaving residents largely in the dark about what's in the air they breathe.\\n\\nAnd the industry is consuming water in an arid region at an unsustainable rate. Permian Basin operators used eight times as much water to frack and drill last year as they did in 2011.\\n\\nPeople with no say in these decisions are stuck with the consequences, said Coyne Gibson, who lives in a part of the Permian that had little oil and gas activity until a few years ago.\\n\\n\\\"The bitter, cynical way to look at this is, West Texas becomes an extraction colony for the fuel resources for the rest of the world,\\\" said Gibson, a Big Bend Conservation Alliance volunteer who once worked in the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nGlobally, there are major trade-offs, too. Scientists warn this drilling rush almost certainly will worsen climate change by increasing the world's fossil fuel use at a fraught time. They say drastic reductions in greenhouse gases are needed to avoid intensifying climate-linked disasters.\\n\\nTwo massive wildfires in California this summer were among the largest in state history. Record-high temperatures in Japan killed more than 100 people in July. September's Hurricane Florence was the most devastating storm ever to hit the Carolinas, while Texas communities are still struggling to recover from Hurricane Harvey, which shattered U.S. rainfall records last year.\\n\\n\\\"Every additional gigaton of carbon that we produce as a global society carries with it a very real cost,\\\" said Katharine Hayhoe, who directs the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University.\\n\\nMeanwhile, companies are building oil and gas infrastructure meant to last decades -- including more than 8,000 miles of pipeline in Texas alone, enough to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific three times over.\\n\\nThe new infrastructure makes it \\\"very unlikely that we can dramatically curtail fossil fuel use,\\\" said Richard York, an environmental studies and sociology professor at the University of Oregon.\\n\\nThe headaches come almost every day. Some mornings Suzanne Franklin wakes with a nose full of dried blood, her voice filled with gravel. Her husband Jim suffers from respiratory problems, too.\\n\\nWhen Franklin moved to Reeves County in 2010, this remote area roughly 100 miles southwest of Midland was a modest oil and gas producer by Texas standards. Now it ranks third in the state for both. Oil production in the county -- which has fewer than 16,000 residents and more land than Delaware -- skyrocketed from 1.6 million barrels in 2010 to more than 60 million last year, the biggest upturn in the Permian.\\n\\nA sign near one of the new wells, less than a mile from the Franklins, warns of the presence of hydrogen sulfide, a contaminant in crude oil and natural gas. In high concentrations it can kill almost instantly; at low levels it can cause chronic illness.\\n\\nA chemical stench hangs in the air here.\\n\\n\\\"When we went past that site yesterday, I could not believe how bad it was,\\\" Suzanne Franklin said in April. \\\"I just had to stop breathing.\\\"\\n\\nComplaints like hers are common among people who live near gas sites, academic research has found. Flares burning off gas spew pollutants that assault the respiratory system.\\n\\nSites flaring natural gas -- a fossil fuel hitchhiker that comes up with the oil here -- are everywhere in the region. From 2016 through May of this year, the Texas Railroad Commission -- which oversees oil and gas production, not railroads -- issued more than 6,300 permits allowing companies to flare in the Permian, compared to 571 in the entire state from 2008 through 2010.\\n\\nRailroad Commission Chairman Christi Craddick thinks the flaring is a shame -- a waste -- but not an urgent reason for a regulatory crackdown. She called the rules sufficient and well-enforced, adding: \\\"Certainty in regulation is important for industry.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to flaring, oil and gas sites release pollutants during \\\"air emission events\\\" -- pollution releases they characterize as unforeseeable, prompted by equipment malfunctions or other problems. If the state agrees they were unavoidable -- and it almost always does -- they don't count against limits established in state permits that companies must obtain.\\n\\n\\\"These are off-the-books -- they're not levels that are authorized in their air pollution permits, but they're happening routinely,\\\" said Ilan Levin, associate director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a research and advocacy group.\\n\\nLast year, businesses in Texas counties atop the Permian reported pumping out 77,000 tons of pollutants during emission events, largely carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. A single gas processing facility in Pecos County reported 103 such events over the 16 months ending in April, or one every five days.\\n\\nYet punishment is rare. A 2017 investigation by The Texas Tribune found that the agency that regulates air pollution, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, hardly ever fines companies when they bust air permit limits. And only four air pollution monitors are stationed in producing areas of the Texas Permian.\\n\\nThe commission said its monitoring and enforcement comply with state and federal law.\\n\\n\\\"Any violations that are documented during TCEQ investigations are addressed using standard agency protocols and are handled consistently statewide,\\\" the agency said in a written statement. It declined to make officials available for interviews.\\n\\nBalmorhea, population 550, has never been an oil-and-gas hub. It's a tourist destination, thanks to its namesake state park that draws more than 200,000 visitors a year to enjoy the world's largest spring-fed swimming pool -- an acre-plus expanse of blue-green water that pops amid the desert landscape.\\n\\nBut now producers have come for the fossil fuels. Two years ago, Houston-based Apache Corporation announced it had discovered vast oil and gas deposits in the area and leased more than 300,000 acres.\\n\\nWorries about the ancient springs that feed the pool and supply water to Balmorhea and nearby Toyahvale prompted the TCEQ to install a water quality monitoring station in the state park and spawned at least five studies. Apache contributed money for three of them.\\n\\n\\\"We spent considerable time and effort conducting baseline air, water and soil studies and cultural, historical and surface impact assessments before development began,\\\" Apache spokeswoman Castlen Kennedy said in a written statement.\\n\\nThe company promised not to drill within the city limits or the state park, but it isn't waiting for the results of all the studies to exploit its new oil and gas play, known as Alpine High. It plans to drill 5,000 wells in the coming decades.\\n\\nContamination isn't the only water fear. Some worry the industry will use too much in a region already struggling with drought.\\n\\nOil and gas companies consumed nearly 58 billion gallons to frack and drill last year in the entire basin, the consulting firm IHS Markit estimated, far outstripping the 6.8 billion used in 2011. By 2023, that's expected to jump to nearly 130 billion gallons -- 19 times the amount of water Midland used last year.\\n\\nThere isn't a state agency policing groundwater use. That's left to local conservation districts with differing opinions about how much to limit water withdrawals or even whether, in cases involving oil and gas, they have any authority to regulate.\\n\\nAnd substantial parts of West Texas don't have a district: Legally, people in those areas can pull as much water from their property as they can pump.\\n\\nThe consequences of the increased water use are unclear: Major data gaps hinder such investigations, said Bridget Scanlon, a senior research scientist for the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology. For example, the state doesn't require companies to divulge the type of water they're using -- such as fresh or brackish -- for their drilling operations.\\n\\nA 2017 study by researchers at the University of Texas found that more than enough contaminated water, known as \\\"produced water,\\\" was flowing up from oil and gas wells to meet industry demand -- if it had been recycled. Instead, most producers inject it into underground disposal wells, which have been linked to earthquakes.\\n\\nSome Permian producers are now recycling. Apache says it's already reusing 80 percent of its produced water in Alpine High and is aiming for 100 percent.\\n\\nBut the state doesn't require recycling. The Railroad Commission merely tweaked its rules to make the practice easier.\\n\\n\\\"I call it the carrot -- ?not the stick -- ?approach,\\\" said Craddick, the commission's chairman. \\\"Water protection and, frankly, protecting the environment is a priority for us.\\\"\\n\\nToyahvale resident Neta Rhyne thinks that's a complete misrepresentation.\\n\\n\\\"Why are they destroying our beautiful desert oasis to send oil to Asia?\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe superintendent of Ector County's school district teared up this spring as he talked about problems that have come with the oil boom.\\n\\nStudent enrollment has doubled in six years. Classrooms are overcrowded. Staffers keep leaving for oilfield jobs; the district is a few hundred teachers short and new hires can't find anywhere they can afford to live. Homelessness among students spiked 26 percent last academic year, with more than 2,100 living in shelters, doubling up with other families or otherwise displaced as housing costs outpace wages.\\n\\n\\\"The thing that really keeps me up at night is, are we giving the kids everything they deserve?\\\" then-Superintendent Tom Crowe said in an April interview, a few months before he retired. \\\"I get emotional about it. I've been doing this a long time and every day I worry, is there a kid out there who slips through the cracks?\\\"\\n\\nThe boom is straining communities across the Permian. Midland County has seen rents rise so fast -- 65 percent since 2010 -- that it's now the most expensive place to lease a home in the state, with Ector County close behind, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development figures.\\n\\nThen there's the traffic -- outright frightening in some places as heavy trucks have multiplied. In Winkler County, population 7,600, accidents are up more than 70 percent this year.\\n\\nOil-related traffic is also chewing up pavement on roads and bridges that weren't designed to carry such heavy loads. Texas Department of Transportation data show the increase in traffic brought by the boom has damaged more than 3,000 miles of state highways in Permian counties. The agency has $3.4 billion worth of projects planned for the area over the next decade -- an investment it describes as \\\"historic\\\" -- but, as of the end of July, it estimated that it still needs more than $1.1 billion for repair work and safety upgrades.\\n\\nOil and gas companies, along with firms that serve them, have responded by paying for some road safety projects and providing housing for their workers.\\n\\nAs they confront the boom's downsides, local leaders across the Permian must make educated guesses about the best ways to respond, laying their bets on how much Permian oil and gas the world will snap up -- and for how long.\\n\\nCraddick, the Railroad Commission chairman who grew up in Midland, said no one can predict a boom's duration, but \\\"I don't think that this is going away in a generation or more.\\\"\\n\\nThe city at the center of the export boom is trying to settle in for the long haul.

He entered a not guilty plea at his initial court appearance Aug. 31 in Knox County Court.\\n\\nConditions of his bail include that he reside at a residence with an individual in South Paris. There is a curfew that requires him to be at that residence from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. daily. He must also report weekly to the Oxford County Sheriff's Office.\\n\\nBail conditions also include that he follow the treatment plan given to him by Maine Behavioral Health. He is also prohibited from having firearms or other dangerous weapons.

In a unanimous decision, the commissioners sided with an administrative law judge's recommendation issued last month.\\n\\nCommissioners said their siting authority is subject to thresholds set in state law, which is 50,000 barrels per day for refineries. Meridian CEO Bill Prentice said in an affidavit that the company has \\\"no current plans\\\" to expand the Davis Refinery beyond 49,500 barrels per day.\\n\\n\\\"This is a close call.

Under the deal, Apple is buying patents, a 300-strong engineering team, most of whom already worked on chips for Apple devices, and Dialog offices in Britain, Italy and Germany.\\n\\nDialog said its 2018 revenue would not be affected and it would continue shipments of existing main power management integrated circuits (PMICs) to Apple. It expects to sell current and future generations of so-called sub-PMICs to Apple.\\n\\nBagherli said that Apple increasingly viewed main PMICs, which are central to the operation of its devices, as a strategic element that it wanted to control directly. This was not the case for sub-PMICs that manage features such as on-board cameras, he told Reuters.\\n\\nAfter the deal, Dialog expects Apple to account for 35-40 percent of its total revenues in 2022. That is down from around 75 percent in the current year. Headcount will fall to 1,800.\\n\\nThe chipmaker also said it would begin a share buyback program for up to 10 percent of its stock following its next quarterly trading update. The $600 million windfall will add to Dialog's already-healthy net cash position of $525 million, analysts said.\\n\\nOther chip designers in Europe have struggled to manage their relationship with Apple due to its sheer scale. Britain's Imagination Technologies ended up being sold to a Chinese-backed fund last year after losing Apple as a client.\\n\\n\\\"Dialog has bought itself much more than just time,\\\" said Karsten Iltgen, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe, which rates the stock 'buy'. \\\"Its Apple business has been clearly defined and put on a sound long-term footing.\\\"\\n\\nHalf of the deal's value, or about $300 million, is cash for the Dialog engineers and offices and the other $300 million is pre-payment to Dialog for supplying chips over the next three years, the companies said.\\n\\nDialog said it would continue to deliver chips to other customers, focusing on the automotive and internet-of-things markets, among others.\\n\\nIt forecast that its sub-PMIC business would achieve compound annual growth rates of 30-35 percent between 2018 and 2022. Its AMS, Connectivity and Automotive \u0026 Industrial business would grow at a 10-15 percent rate.\\n\\nThe deal represents an expansion of Apple's chip design operations, which kicked into high gear in 2010 when the company released its first custom processor for the iPad and iPhone.\\n\\nApple is buying about 16 percent of Dialog's workforce. Apple said these employees would stay in Europe and would report to Johny Srouji, the company's senior vice president of hardware technologies who oversees Apple's chip design efforts.\\n\\n\\\"Our relationship with Dialog goes all the way back to the early iPhones, and we look forward to continuing this long-standing relationship with them,\\\" Srouji said. Apple has added around 20,000 employees in Europe since 2000. It already has a chip design centers in Munich, Germany, where it employs 1,000 staff, and St Albans, Britain. The deal will give Apple four more from Dialog, in Livorno in Italy, Swindon in Britain, and Nabern and Neuaubing in Germany.\\n\\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closings and regulator approvals, Dialog said. It expects annual operational savings of $35 million from the deal, but declined to give more detail on its financial impact ahead of an investor presentation on Nov. 1.\\n\\nDialog said Qatalyst Partners acted as its financial adviser and Linklaters as its legal counsel.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Frankfurt\"","lat":50,"lng":8,"__v":0}

Recent efforts have focused on nanoscale delivery vehicles with immune components, but these vehicles are often still too large (20 nanometers or larger) for renal clearance after imaging.\\n\\nUlrich Wiesner, the Spencer T. Olin Professor of Engineering in materials science and engineering at Cornell University, in collaboration with Dr. Michelle Bradbury of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Weill Cornell Medicine, has proposed a novel approach using ultrasmall silica nanoparticles - better known as \\\"Cornell dots\\\" (or C dots) - invented in his lab more than a dozen years ago.\\n\\nTheir team - including researchers at pharmaceutical company MedImmune - have equipped the C dots with antibody fragments. Because the resulting conjugates are smaller than 8 nanometers, these C dots allow for renal clearance while achieving the specificity needed for efficient tumor targeting.\\n\\nThey report their discovery in \\\"Ultrasmall Targeted Nanoparticles with Engineered Antibody Fragments for Imaging Detection of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer,\\\" published Oct. 8 in Nature Communications. Feng Chen, senior research scientist at MSKCC, and Kai Ma, postdoctoral researcher in the Wiesner lab, are co-lead authors.\\n\\nWiesner said this research creates \\\"a whole new runway\\\" to employ antibody fragments for a number of diseases, cancer in particular, and for diagnostics as well as drug delivery - when combined in a single entity also known as \\\"theranostics.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is the first time we've worked with these antibody fragments,\\\" Wiesner said, \\\"thereby harnessing the power of antibodies in the fight against cancer.\\\"\\n\\nCornell dots and their newer generation - termed \\\"Cornell prime dots,\\\" or simply C' dots - have evolved since Wiesner and his group introduced them in 2005 and since, in collaboration with Bradbury, a first clinical trial deemed them safe for humans in 2014. Two years ago, the dots were shown to have the ability not only to detect cancer cells but to be self-therapeutic thereby actually killing them.\\n\\nThis latest research puts C dots back into the role of cancer-finder, but adds a \\\"tumor finder\\\" in the form of an antibody fragment. They used a particular fragment of the Y-shaped antibody, as opposed to the whole molecule, to keep the C' dot within the size threshold for renal clearance.\\n\\nThe target: HER2-positive breast cancer, more aggressive and deadly than HER2-negative cancer, making it an attractive target for new diagnostics and therapies. In the collaboration, MedImmune engineered an antibody fragment specifically to target the HER2 protein and a conjugation site not interfering with its binding activity. The groups of Wiesner and Bradbury, meanwhile, worked together to attach it to the C' dot surface to keep the overall conjugate below 8 nanometers in diameter.\\n\\nThe dot itself was synthesized in a way that gave it five distinct functions, all within its ultrasmall size of 6 to 7 nanometers.\\n\\nBoth in vitro and in vivo (mouse) targeting of HER2-positive breast cancer cells were successful, with in vivo tumor uptake of the injected dots as high as 17.2 percent, the highest Wiesner and Bradbury have achieved in all of their C dot research.\\n\\n\\\"The injection circulates through the blood and has to escape the vasculature, has to diffuse through the connective tissue, has to associate with the tumor and then kind of penetrate the tumor body,\\\" Wiesner said. \\\"We want 100 percent - everybody wants 100 percent. But when you consider all of the other things that are competing for the vehicle elsewhere in the body, 17 percent is not that small.\\\"\\n\\nBradbury, who along with Wiesner directs the MSK-Cornell Center for Translation of Cancer Nanomedicines, calls the C' dot a \\\"game-changer\\\" in nanoparticle-based drug delivery.\\n\\n\\\"These research findings are very exciting,\\\" she said, \\\"as they suggest we could specifically deliver a variety of small molecule therapies - chemotherapy, inhibitors and radiotherapy - without the toxicity typically found using larger particle probes.\\\"\\n\\nDoctoral student Melik Turker from the Wiesner group also contributed to this work, as did researchers from Sloan Kettering and the University of Missouri.\\n\\nFunding for this work came from MedImmune, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca, as well as grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Sloan Kettering Institute.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Ithaca, New York\"","lat":42,"lng":-76,"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8f1b"},"title":"\"Scramble for Holiday Season Workers Already Near Fever Pitch\"","body":"\"WASHINGTON -- Companies that depend on holiday season sales will need more workers at a time when the ranks of the unemployed have dwindled to their lowest level since the recession.\\n\\nEnvisioning an even tougher struggle than in recent years, many are taking steps they've not tried before to recruit seasonal workers like offering higher pay, dangling bonuses and providing more full-time, rather than part-time, work. Some warehousing companies that fear they still won't be able to fill enough jobs, are turning to automation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the U.S. job market is the tightest it's been in five decades, consumer confidence is near an 18-year high and online shopping is surging.\\n\\n\\\"I can't remember the last time it was this tight,\\\" said Tony Lee, a vice president at the Society for Human Resource Management. \\\"You are going to see a real battle for seasonal employees.\\\"\\n\\nAt 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is at a 49-year low, and the government says a record 6.9 million job openings are being advertised -- more than the number of unemployed Americans.\\n\\nWith more job seekers able to choose among employers, many companies have rushed to begin their seasonal hiring earlier than before. Kohl's, the nationwide discount chain, with 1,100 stores, tried to get a jump on its rivals by advertising seasonal jobs back in late June.\\n\\nUPS is holding its first-ever nationwide job fair next week. In 170 locations, applicants can have interviews on the spot, and driver candidates can schedule a road test. On its job-fair day -- which it's dubbing \\\"Brown Friday\\\" -- UPS hopes to hire up to 40,000 of the more than 100,000 seasonal workers it will need.\\n\\nSakeria Crawford, who will start a start a seasonal package-handling job with UPS next month, will earn about $13 an hour -- the most she's ever made.\\n\\n\\\"I'm very, very happy that I even have the opportunity,\\\" said Crawford, 24, of Atlanta who has a 3-year-old son. \\\"I need something stable.\\\"\\n\\nTarget wants to hire 120,000 seasonal workers, 20 percent more than last year. The company has raised its starting wage by a dollar to $12 an hour. Applications jumped 20 percent in the first week after they were announced compared with the same period last year, according to Angie Thompson, a Target spokeswoman.\\n\\nThe company is further raising its minimum wage, in stages, to $15 by 2020. Yet Amazon beat it to the punch just last week by announcing that it would boost its starting hourly wage to $15 on Nov. 1.\\n\\n\\\"It's an investment in the future growth of the company and to ensure that we can continue to hire, retain, and develop the best talent for years to come,\\\" said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations.\\n\\nAmazon, the nation's second-largest private employer after Walmart, says it wants to hire applicants quickly. Its online job ads stress not what is required but what isn't: \\\"No resume. No interview.\\\" Meanwhile, Walmart plans to manage the holiday rush by providing more hours to its part-time workers, a step it implemented just two years ago.\\n\\nIndeed, retailers are posting far more full-time jobs compared with last year, and fewer part-time positions, according to research by Indeed, a job-listing website. The proportion of retail jobs that are part time, like sales associates at clothing stores, plummeted this year compared with 2017.\\n\\nWith lesser resources, smaller retailers are struggling to keep up with the higher pay and greater perks. Steve Fusek, who owns Fusek's True Value Hardware in Indianapolis, says he had already found it a challenge to find workers who could reliably show up on time. Making matters worse, his store is just 10 miles from an Amazon warehouse and he expects to have to raise his starting hourly pay by a dollar or two from $10 to compete.\\n\\nRadial, an e-commerce company based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania that fills online orders for such retailers as Shoe Carnival, PetSmart and Kate Spade, has had to offer more perks than before. It wants to recruit more than 20,000 workers for its 22 distribution centers and five customer call centers.\\n\\nSean McCartney, an executive vice president, said Radial raised hourly pay for its holiday workers in four more markets than it did last year, though he wouldn't say which ones. The company is also offering bonuses of $1,000 or more in the most competitive markets to those who work during the crucial \\\"Black Friday\\\" weekend after Thanksgiving.\\n\\nThat bonus is helping keep Linda Connor-Lewis happy about her job packing online orders at Radial's warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky, even though her email inbox is stuffed with invitations to job fairs at rival companies. Though Connor-Lewis, 54, already has a permanent job with Radial, she plans to work 30 more hours of work a week on top of her current 40-hour schedule and expects to earn more in holiday bonuses than she did last year.\\n\\nAt XPO Logistics, a firm that specializes in shipping appliances, furniture, and other large items that Americans are increasingly willing to order online, plans are to hire 8,000 workers -- one-third more than last year. XPO is also installing 5,000 robots in its warehouses in the United States and Europe.\\n\\n\\\"The combination of man plus machine is the best way to give our customers an edge,\\\" said Bradley Jacobs, the company's CEO.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

And I'd like our Fed not to be so aggressive because I think they're making a big mistake,\\\" Trump said in a Thursday morning interview on Fox \u0026 Friends.\\n\\nIt was his second broadside against the U.S. central bank in the last 24 hours, following a sell-off on Wall Street partly attributed to investors fully adjusting to the central bank's steady rate increases, and an uptick in particular in yields on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds that are an important, more secure alternative to stock investments.\\n\\nPast presidents have criticized their central bankers, but this was an unusual run of invective even for Trump. Since the close of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street he has called the Fed \\\"crazy,\\\" \\\"loco,\\\" \\\"ridiculous,\\\" and \\\"too cute,\\\" while saying its rate increases are \\\"too aggressive,\\\" and \\\"a big mistake.\\\" U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"The problem that I have is with the Fed. The Fed is going wild. I mean I don't know what their problem is but they are raising interest rates and it's ridiculous,\\\" Trump said late Wednesday night. \\\"The problem in my opinion is Treasuries and the Fed. The Fed is going loco and there is no reason for them to do it and I'm not happy about it.\\\"\\n\\nA Fed official said the central bank would not comment on the president's remarks.\\n\\nGlobal economic leaders including International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde came to the Fed's defense, noting that the independence of monetary policy from the influence of elected officials has become a touchstone of effective economic governance, and helps prevent politicians from using cheap money to further their own interests.\\n\\nAt IMF meetings in Bali, Lagarde said she \\\"would not associate\\\" Fed chair Jerome Powell \\\"with craziness.\\\"\\n\\nThe Fed raised interest rates last month, and is expected to do so again in December. Fed officials including Powell, Trump's handpicked chair, have said pointedly that they will not be influenced by comments from elected officials, and will make decisions based on economic data.\\n\\nThat has so far been strong enough to warrant steady rate hikes, a sign from the Fed's perspective of an economy that has recovered more completely from the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. At just over 2 percent, the Fed's short-term policy rate remains low by historic standards, and most indexes of borrowing costs and credit flows still regard broader financial conditions as \\\"loose\\\" and conducive to economic growth.\\n\\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has risen to around 3.1 percent from around 2.1 percent over the past year.\\n\\nThe gradually rising rates, Fed officials say, are meant to guard against any quick run-up in inflation, while remaining low enough so far for the recovery and a strong run of job growth to continue.\\n\\nThe policy could eventually bite harder into parts of the economy that are both sensitive to interest rates and connected to politically important industries, such as autos and home construction and sales.\\n\\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu, Susan Heavey and Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\\n\\nBy Howard Schneider and Susan Heavey\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington, D.C.\"","lat":38,"lng":-77,"__v":0}

The service has been contracted by over 100 new school districts in the past year to support transportation needs including school commuting, athletics, field trips and after-school activities.\\n\\nIn all, Zūm is now transporting children to more than 2,000 California public, private and charter schools, with a collective 750,000 students in attendance. The company also offers safe, personalized transportation and flexible child care services to individual families who can pre-schedule rides for their children to and from school, as well as after-school activities and weekend events. Zūm's service area currently covers 197 cities in California, and the company plans to continue its rapid expansion to other regions in the coming months.\\n\\n\\\"Our district is passionate about meeting the needs of our 4,600 students and we do so by focusing on safety, efficiency and progressive solutions. Zūm has been a critical ally in helping us tackle the transportation needs of our students by optimizing key routes.

The report also highlights the family and personal factors -- such as parents' limited knowledge of the higher education system, socioeconomic status, and proximity to a college or university -- that affect college-going rates in rural areas.\\n\\nCollege Success Arizona conducted focus groups with students and parents in rural communities across the state. These focus groups were conducted in May 2018, at high schools in each community. College Success Arizona also conducted supplemental interviews with school administrators throughout Arizona.\\n\\n\\\"Students don't know what they don't know. They don't know where to look. And they don't know what to look for. For many students, their parents may not have gone to college, and so they may not know what colleges offer and they may not know what programs there are to find out what the options are,\\\" said one rural school administrator, summing up the challenges the information gap poses for students and families in the community.\\n\\nThe project, supported by Freeport-McMoRan Inc., is part of a larger effort by College Success Arizona to create a statewide framework for enhancing the quality and volume of college readiness and access to information, as well as to create knowledge and develop behaviors that can improve the college-going culture in the state.\\n\\nCollege Success Arizona is committed to helping more students in our state access a postsecondary education and attain a certificate or degree that will enable them to compete in Arizona's increasingly dynamic workforce and provide them with greater economic mobility. Central to our work is an ongoing effort to identify and understand the barriers that prevent students in Arizona from applying to, enrolling in, and graduating from a postsecondary institution.\\n\\nAbout College Success Arizona\\n\\nCollege Success Arizona is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization working to significantly increase the post-secondary attainment rate of students in Arizona, particularly for those who otherwise would not be able to attend or graduate.

In data for 2017, the Census Bureau found that 13.7 percent of the U.S. population was foreign-born. LendingTree researchers analyzed Census data to identify how cities in the U.S. rank in terms of the proportion of homes owned by foreign-born households.\\n\\nKey findings\\n\\nCities with larger foreign-born populations and homeowners have higher home prices. Prices for the top 10 cities average $491,750 compared with $167,560 for the bottom 10. But the lead city has modest home prices. Miami is top of the list with 26 percent of homes owned by foreign-born residents but has a median price of just $278,700. Immigrants love the coasts. The rest of the top five are also coastal cities, all in California with 17 percent and higher foreign-born homeownership rates and home prices above $300,000. Some bargains are available. In addition to Miami, more affordable cities with high immigrant populations include Houston at No. 6 and Las Vegas at No. 7. Cheaper cities are mostly shunned. Immigrants show little interest in bargain hunting in the cities towards the bottom of the list.

Thus, homeowners in cities with high foreign-born populations benefit from faster home price appreciation, creating opportunities for them to access this wealth via refinancing or home equity extraction. This added spending can in turn boost the economy or provide capital to fund new businesses.\\\"\\n\\nTo view the full report, visit: https://www.lendingtree.com/home/lendingtree-reveals-the-cities-with-the-most-foreign-born-homeowners\\n\\nRank\\n\\nMetro\\n\\nForeign-born\\n\\nHomeownership\\n\\nRate\\n\\nNative-born\\n\\nHomeownership\\n\\nRate\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nHomeownership\\n\\nRate\\n\\nForeign-\\n\\nborn to\\n\\ntotal\\n\\npopulation\\n\\nratio\\n\\nMedian\\n\\nHome\\n\\nPrice\\n\\n1\\n\\nMiami\\n\\n25.70%\\n\\n33.70%\\n\\n59.50%\\n\\n41.00%\\n\\n$278,700\\n\\n2\\n\\nSan Jose, Calif.\\n\\n24.80%\\n\\n32.40%\\n\\n57.20%\\n\\n38.90%\\n\\n$957,700\\n\\n3\\n\\nLos Angeles\\n\\n18.30%\\n\\n30.10%\\n\\n48.40%\\n\\n33.30%\\n\\n$617,100\\n\\n4\\n\\nSan Francisco\\n\\n17.90%\\n\\n36.70%\\n\\n54.60%\\n\\n31.30%\\n\\n$849,500\\n\\n5\\n\\nRiverside, Calif.\\n\\n17.30%\\n\\n45.70%\\n\\n63.00%\\n\\n20.60%\\n\\n$342,300\\n\\n6\\n\\nHouston\\n\\n16.60%\\n\\n44.10%\\n\\n60.70%\\n\\n23.60%\\n\\n$192,900\\n\\n7\\n\\nLas Vegas\\n\\n14.60%\\n\\n39.50%\\n\\n54.20%\\n\\n23.10%\\n\\n$250,000\\n\\n8\\n\\nNew York\\n\\n14.40%\\n\\n37.40%\\n\\n51.80%\\n\\n29.20%\\n\\n$440,900\\n\\n9\\n\\nWashington\\n\\n14.30%\\n\\n49.30%\\n\\n63.60%\\n\\n23.10%\\n\\n$424,600\\n\\n10\\n\\nSan Diego\\n\\n12.90%\\n\\n40.60%\\n\\n53.50%\\n\\n23.30%\\n\\n$563,800\\n\\n11\\n\\nChicago\\n\\n12.80%\\n\\n51.60%\\n\\n64.40%\\n\\n18.00%\\n\\n$240,300\\n\\n12\\n\\nDallas\\n\\n11.70%\\n\\n47.90%\\n\\n59.70%\\n\\n18.70%\\n\\n$214,900\\n\\n13\\n\\nOrlando, Fla.\\n\\n11.60%\\n\\n48.80%\\n\\n60.40%\\n\\n18.70%\\n\\n$219,000\\n\\n14\\n\\nSacramento, Calif.\\n\\n11.40%\\n\\n48.90%\\n\\n60.20%\\n\\n19.10%\\n\\n$390,000\\n\\n15\\n\\nSeattle\\n\\n11.00%\\n\\n49.00%\\n\\n60.00%\\n\\n18.80%\\n\\n$439,800\\n\\n16\\n\\nBoston\\n\\n9.70%\\n\\n52.10%\\n\\n61.80%\\n\\n19.00%\\n\\n$441,400\\n\\n17\\n\\nAtlanta\\n\\n9.40%\\n\\n53.60%\\n\\n63.00%\\n\\n14.10%\\n\\n$215,100\\n\\n18\\n\\nPhoenix\\n\\n9.40%\\n\\n54.30%\\n\\n63.70%\\n\\n14.20%\\n\\n$246,900\\n\\n19\\n\\nHartford, Conn.\\n\\n9.30%\\n\\n57.20%\\n\\n66.50%\\n\\n13.50%\\n\\n$247,900\\n\\n20\\n\\nTampa, Fla.\\n\\n9.00%\\n\\n55.40%\\n\\n64.40%\\n\\n14.20%\\n\\n$191,200\\n\\n21\\n\\nAustin, Texas\\n\\n9.00%\\n\\n48.70%\\n\\n57.70%\\n\\n15.10%\\n\\n$283,600\\n\\n22\\n\\nSan Antonio\\n\\n8.30%\\n\\n54.90%\\n\\n63.30%\\n\\n11.60%\\n\\n$170,100\\n\\n23\\n\\nRaleigh, N.C.\\n\\n8.10%\\n\\n58.90%\\n\\n67.00%\\n\\n12.80%\\n\\n$244,500\\n\\n24\\n\\nSalt Lake City\\n\\n8.00%\\n\\n60.00%\\n\\n68.00%\\n\\n12.50%\\n\\n$294,800\\n\\n25\\n\\nPortland, Ore.\\n\\n7.70%\\n\\n55.50%\\n\\n63.20%\\n\\n12.50%\\n\\n$376,000\\n\\n26\\n\\nProvidence, R.I.\\n\\n7.60%\\n\\n54.20%\\n\\n61.90%\\n\\n13.60%\\n\\n$277,400\\n\\n27\\n\\nPhiladelphia\\n\\n7.40%\\n\\n58.60%\\n\\n66.10%\\n\\n11.10%\\n\\n$250,900\\n\\n28\\n\\nDenver\\n\\n7.20%\\n\\n57.00%\\n\\n64.10%\\n\\n12.30%\\n\\n$386,800\\n\\n29\\n\\nDetroit\\n\\n7.00%\\n\\n61.90%\\n\\n68.90%\\n\\n10.30%\\n\\n$171,600\\n\\n30\\n\\nBaltimore\\n\\n6.80%\\n\\n59.80%\\n\\n66.60%\\n\\n11.00%\\n\\n$297,300\\n\\n31\\n\\nJacksonville, Fla.\\n\\n6.20%\\n\\n57.50%\\n\\n63.60%\\n\\n9.40%\\n\\n$205,100\\n\\n32\\n\\nCharlotte, N.C.\\n\\n6.10%\\n\\n59.50%\\n\\n65.60%\\n\\n10.20%\\n\\n$197,100\\n\\n33\\n\\nMinneapolis\\n\\n5.50%\\n\\n64.70%\\n\\n70.20%\\n\\n11.00%\\n\\n$254,800\\n\\n34\\n\\nOklahoma City\\n\\n4.70%\\n\\n58.80%\\n\\n63.50%\\n\\n7.40%\\n\\n$156,800\\n\\n35\\n\\nRochester, N.Y.\\n\\n4.50%\\n\\n62.10%\\n\\n66.60%\\n\\n7.20%\\n\\n$144,500\\n\\n36\\n\\nRichmond, Va.\\n\\n4.50%\\n\\n61.80%\\n\\n66.20%\\n\\n7.40%\\n\\n$237,900\\n\\n37\\n\\nVirginia Beach, Va.\\n\\n4.20%\\n\\n57.80%\\n\\n62.00%\\n\\n6.50%\\n\\n$245,900\\n\\n38\\n\\nMilwaukee\\n\\n4.10%\\n\\n55.60%\\n\\n59.70%\\n\\n7.30%\\n\\n$213,800\\n\\n39\\n\\nNashville, Tenn.\\n\\n4.10%\\n\\n61.00%\\n\\n65.00%\\n\\n8.10%\\n\\n$242,900\\n\\n40\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\n4.00%\\n\\n60.40%\\n\\n64.40%\\n\\n5.80%\\n\\n$150,400\\n\\n41\\n\\nIndianapolis\\n\\n3.80%\\n\\n61.60%\\n\\n65.40%\\n\\n7.20%\\n\\n$162,200\\n\\n42\\n\\nBuffalo, N.Y.\\n\\n3.70%\\n\\n61.80%\\n\\n65.50%\\n\\n6.50%\\n\\n$148,900\\n\\n43\\n\\nKansas City, Mo.\\n\\n3.60%\\n\\n61.00%\\n\\n64.60%\\n\\n6.70%\\n\\n$180,700\\n\\n44\\n\\nColumbus, Ohio\\n\\n3.60%\\n\\n58.20%\\n\\n61.80%\\n\\n7.80%\\n\\n$182,300\\n\\n45\\n\\nNew Orleans\\n\\n3.50%\\n\\n58.70%\\n\\n62.20%\\n\\n7.50%\\n\\n$193,100\\n\\n46\\n\\nMemphis, Tenn.\\n\\n2.90%\\n\\n57.30%\\n\\n60.30%\\n\\n5.40%\\n\\n$148,800\\n\\n47\\n\\nSt. Louis\\n\\n2.80%\\n\\n66.10%\\n\\n68.90%\\n\\n4.90%\\n\\n$172,200\\n\\n48\\n\\nCincinnati\\n\\n2.70%\\n\\n63.20%\\n\\n65.90%\\n\\n5.00%\\n\\n$165,500\\n\\n49\\n\\nLouisville, Ky.\\n\\n2.70%\\n\\n64.10%\\n\\n66.80%\\n\\n5.90%\\n\\n$168,600\\n\\n50\\n\\nPittsburgh\\n\\n2.10%\\n\\n67.80%\\n\\n69.90%\\n\\n3.80%\\n\\n$153,300\\n\\nAbout LendingTree\\n\\nLendingTree (NASDAQ: TREE) is the nation's leading online marketplace that connects consumers with the choices they need to be confident in their financial decisions.

Existing digital solutions are cumbersome, expensive, and out of reach of many companies, slowing down a critical step in bringing potentially lifesaving innovations to market. San Francisco's ClinCapture has created an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) technology that drastically streamlines and accelerates clinical trials by moving data collection and workflows - including Randomization, electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO), and Medical Dictionary Coding - online.\\n\\nScott Weidley, CEO of ClinCapture, believes in the value of accelerating the clinical trials process through technology, saving companies up to 80% in set-up costs. \\\"There are a lot of great service providers in the pharma industry,\\\" Weidley says, \\\"but very few great technologies exist that simplify the process for clinical data managers while keeping clinical research sites operating smoothly.\\\"\\n\\nClinCapture utilizes a unique private cloud infrastructure capable of deploying clinical study data to individual software instances for added data privacy and database performance. Clinical researchers are no longer forced to interrupt research with mid-study re-validation. The EDC technology can quickly be configured to support trials even in complex therapeutic areas, such as oncology. With an increase of complex, multi-site trials being performed, companies of all sizes need EDC technology that is affordable, fast, and scalable.\\n\\n\\\"In ClinCapture, we've found a team that not only has experience building terrific clinical trials companies, but also sees the future of clinical trials. We're excited about their existing products as well as the product pipeline and reach, which we believe to be industry-leading,\\\" said Anya Schiess of Healthy Ventures.\\n\\n\\\"We're delighted about the opportunity to back a team like ClinCapture with a product that will have incredible impact on new channels for innovation in life sciences,\\\" said Rock Health Managing Director, Bill Evans. \\\"ClinCapture's solution is uniquely positioned to help solve the most complex clinical trial needs of its customers.

The French leader isn't interested. At least, that's what he wants people to think.\\n\\nFrance's president is turning a government reshuffle into a soapbox against the time-pressures of modern politics and wall-to-wall news coverage.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, Macron's government is struggling to quickly plug the gap left by the sudden resignation last week of his interior minister, Gerard Collomb.\\n\\nBut Macron and his aides are spinning the delay in appointing a replacement. The message from his office: Relax everyone.\\n\\n\\\"He makes no apologies for taking time in order to do this famous reshuffle,\\\" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said, just before Macron set off Wednesday afternoon for an overseas trip to Armenia that will further postpone the appointment of a new minister at least until the president's return on Friday.\\n\\nCollomb's resignation, to free him up to re-run as mayor of the southeastern city of Lyon, initially appeared to blind-side Macron, who tried but failed to get the minister to reconsider. His departure was so sudden that when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and European interior ministers gathered for a long-planned meeting to discuss anti-terrorism and other issues this week, Macron's prime minister had to be dispatched to greet them, standing in temporarily in the absence of a French interior minister.\\n\\nOpposition leaders quickly argued that not swiftly replacing Collomb was symptomatic of a government in disarray. Guillaume Peltier of the right-wing Republicans asked if France \\\"still has a captain.\\\" A \\\"mess,\\\" sniffed far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon.\\n\\nSometimes proudly sporting a made-in-France watch, on a red-white-and-blue wrist-strap, Macron likes to describe himself as the \\\"master of the clocks.\\\" But he is almost always late -- even at meetings with other heads of states. As the days without a reshuffle have stretched beyond a week, Macron has sought to use the mini-saga to signal that his schedule is his own and that he won't be pushed around.\\n\\nUsually, reshuffles take a few days, at most. One reason this one is taking longer may be that Macron has equilibriums to maintain. Recruiting more men than women to his administration would violate his promise of equality between the sexes. Recruiting too heavily from the left or right wings of French politics would risk tilting his government too far from its centrist, middle-way axis. And background checks have to be conducted to ensure that candidates don't have legal or other skeletons in their closet that could soil Macron in the same way that ugly scandals undermined previous French administrations.\\n\\nIn short, Macron is far too busy to be rushed.\\n\\n\\\"He takes responsibility for breaking with usual practices when some were changing the minister of so-and-so within a few hours, moving him from one ministry to another,\\\" Griveaux said. \\\"He said, with his own words, that ministers were not objects on shelves but people with whom it was necessary to have an extensive dialogue before deciding to give them the important mission we have started of transforming the country.\\\"\\n\\nSo hold the presses.\\n\\nAs 24-hour news channels have breathlessly speculated about who might be shuffled to which ministry and talked of a possible split between Macron and his prime minister over candidates, the French leader took a sunset stroll on Tuesday evening along the banks of the Seine River, where lovers have long hoped that time will stand still.\\n\\nA journalist who seemingly happened to luck across the unusual scene snapped Macron walking ahead of his bodyguards, a mobile phone glued to his ear . \\\"Crisis? What crisis?\\\" the image seemed to say.\\n\\nMacron has even coined a phrase -- the \\\"tyranny of immediacy\\\" -- to describe his manifest refusal to become enslaved by the tick-tock, tick-tock of the right-here, right-now. Defending the right to take one's time all seems very French, fitting with France's fondness for leisure, for two-hour lunches and slow food.\\n\\nIt's a far cry from the famously frenetic style of one of Macron's recent predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy. He was so in a hurry as president that he dared to remove cheese from presidential palace menus so meals would go quicker. That anecdote came courtesy of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who lamented the axing of fromage at the Elysee Palace.\\n\\nSooner, or later, there'll be a new minister, probably more than one if the reshuffle concerns several portfolios.\\n\\nEDITOR'S NOTE -- Sylvie Corbet has covered French politics for The Associated Press since 2010, and John Leicester has been based in France for the AP since 2002 and was the Paris bureau chief from 2005-2009.\\n\\nEDITOR'S NOTE _ Sylvie Corbet has covered French politics for The Associated Press since 2010, and John Leicester has been based in France for AP since 2002 and was the Paris bureau chief from 2005-2009.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Paris\"","lat":48,"lng":2,"__v":0}

As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate funded ratio of these plans was at 81%, down from 83% at the end of 2017.\\n\\nThe drop in funded ratio is largely due to lackluster performance by investment returns, which were flat through the first six months of 2018. Milliman's simplified portfolio earned about 0.2% for the first half of the year, well below the 3% to 4% assumed rate of return for most plans and in stark contrast to the 16% aggregate return experienced in 2017.\\n\\n\\\"We've said it before and we'll say it again: the funded status of multiemployer pensions is primarily driven by investment performance,\\\" says Kevin Campe, a principal and consulting actuary at Milliman and co-author of the report. \\\"As Congress explores potential solutions to improve the solvency of these pensions, plans need to continue looking for ways to reduce risk exposure and protect their members in the case of a potential stock market downturn.\\\"\\n\\nAs of June 30, 2018, 355 of the plans studied had a funded ratio at or above 100%, while 258 plans had a funded ratio at or under 70%.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bbf5bf52dd2940f803f8f2d"},"title":"\"IMF International Monetary Fund : Intergovernmental Group of Twenty Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development\"","body":"\"Bali, Indonesia\\n\\nOctober 11, 2018\\n\\n1. We held our 100th meeting in Bali, Indonesia with Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance and Mass Media of Sri Lanka, as Chair, Julio Velarde, Governor of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as 1st Vice‑Chair and Yaw Osafo‑Maafo, Senior Minister of the Republic of Ghana, as 2nd Vice‑Chair.\\n\\n2. We would like to thank the Government of Indonesia for hosting the Annual Meetings and for their warm hospitality. We would also like to express our sympathy and condolences to Indonesia and extend our support following the devastating aftermath of the recent tragic events.\\n\\n3. While the recovery of global growth continues, risks have shifted to the downside. We are concerned that growth is becoming increasingly uneven, including among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Our members are managing the impact of tightening financial conditions from the ongoing monetary policy normalization in advanced countries, but a rapid shift in financial market sentiment could set back the growth recovery. We are concerned with the uncertainty from the trade tensions and protectionist sentiments that further cloud our growth outlook. We recognize the urgency of domestic policy actions to strengthen resilience, but underscore that multilateral actions are necessary to ensure financial stability and global growth.\\n\\n4. We strongly call for international cooperation to foster a rules‑based, open, transparent, non‑discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its center. We stand ready to participate in global efforts to improve the global trading system so that it facilitates sustainable development, ensures a fair distribution of benefits and keeps pace with technological change. To enhance the benefits of trade for EMDEs, we ask for increased engagement from international organizations on regional integration and more effective global governance of trade.\\n\\n5. We call for international policy coordination to reduce adverse spillovers from domestic policies in advanced economies so as to limit the recurring periods of instability that disrupt growth in EMDEs. In the context of International Monetary Fund (IMF) surveillance, a continued evenhanded and context‑based assessment of macro‑prudential and capital flow management measures is important to support countries in implementing appropriate measures to ensure financial stability.\\n\\n6. The current challenging financial conditions underscore the importance of a strong Global Financial Safety Net with an adequately resourced, quota‑based IMF at its center. It is critical to at least maintain the IMF's current lending capacity by increasing quotas and reducing its dependence on borrowed resources. While bilateral borrowing agreements played an important role during the global financial crisis, they will expire at year end 2019. We encourage strengthened cooperation between the Fund and Regional Financial Arrangements. We call for continued adaptation of the Fund's toolkit, including program design and conditionality, to members' evolving circumstances and needs. We encourage the IMF to revive the discussion on a short‑term liquidity swap instrument. Furthermore, we call for even‑handed surveillance and lending decisions by the IMF. We support further work to explore a possible enhanced role for Special Drawing Rights as an instrument for international cooperation and as an international reserve currency.\\n\\n7. Regarding the IMF's review of its facilities for low‑income countries (LICs), we call for increased access limits for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) and credible mechanisms to boost PRGT resources, effectiveness and impact. We further encourage keeping the Policy Support Instrument alongside the newly established Policy Coordination Instrument, enhancing precautionary financing and increasing the scope for blending with non‑concessional financing. We look forward to the Fund's actions to enhance engagement with fragile states in line with the recommendations of the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office.\\n\\n8. We urge stronger support from international financial institutions (IFIs) and the international community to developing countries that are disproportionately affected by refugee crises and involuntary displacement, which have created severe economic and social pressures in some countries in the Middle East and Africa and, more recently in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. There is an urgent need to act collectively to deal with the consequences and causes of the ongoing crises. We encourage continued pursuit of cooperative developmental approaches to address this serious challenge. We look forward to the outcomes of the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.\\n\\n9. We are concerned with rising debt vulnerabilities. We urge the international financial community to strengthen its support of developing countries' efforts to deal with the interrelated challenges of debt and growth. Flexible implementation of the LIC Debt Sustainability Framework and Debt Limits Policy should accommodate countries' much needed infrastructure and social spending while preserving debt sustainability. We call for stronger and faster action from the IMF, World Bank Group (WBG), multilateral partners and donors on capacity building for fiscal and debt management, improving debt transparency and developing domestic capital markets. We encourage countries to maintain institutional capacity in these critical areas. We emphasize the joint responsibilities of debtors and creditors in fostering debt transparency and sustainability, and also encourage effective creditor coordination.\\n\\n10. The success of adjustment and reform efforts to strengthen inclusive growth and improve debt sustainability will equally depend on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for LICs. We are concerned with the almost 20 percent decline of Official Development Assistance to LICs between 2013 and 2016, and urge donor countries to take steps to reverse this trend.\\n\\n11. Debt sustainability risks are also acute for developing countries vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change. We stress the importance of IMF and WBG support, including utilizing innovative approaches to help countries build resilience and unlock climate change financing.\\n\\n12. We call on the IMF and WBG to strengthen their support for domestic resource mobilization, combating illicit financial flows and mitigating the adverse social and distributional impact of fiscal adjustment. In addition, international tax cooperation is essential to develop fair rules and avert harmful tax practices and competition. International tax cooperation should be cognizant of the challenges, country circumstances and priorities of EMDEs. We welcome the interim report of the G‑24 Working Group on tax policies and international tax cooperation, which lays out approaches to peer learning, capacity building, implementation of the automatic and on request exchange of information and perspectives on issues such as the taxation of the digital economy, extractive industries and indirect transfer of assets.\\n\\n13. Private financing for infrastructure and development is unlikely to reach the scale envisioned in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to support the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), individually and jointly, are uniquely placed to play a significant role in supporting an enabling investment environment and de‑risking investments in developing countries. They should step up to this role. By working together, they could harness the untapped potential to pool and diversify risks across the MDB system, create new asset classes for private investors and draw on their respective strengths to maximize development impact in supporting country‑led programs. More broadly, we call upon MDBs to urgently scale up their financing ambition and development effectiveness to support all client countries in meeting the SDGs, while recognizing countries' priorities and national circumstances.\\n\\n14. Technological change creates opportunities for inclusive growth but also risks from a wider technological divide as well as economic and social exclusion. We welcome the IMF/WBG Bali Fintech Agenda that lays out key issues to consider in formulating policy approaches to capture the benefits from technological change and safeguard against its risks to financial stability, integrity and consumer protection. We note the WBG's enhanced emphasis on developing human capital and strongly suggest that this be linked to the jobs and economic transformation agenda. We note the ongoing work by the WBG on the Human Capital Index (HCI) and look forward to further improvements of the methodology and new available data through capacity building and investment in data collection. We caution on the inappropriate use of the Index to rank countries' performance.\\n\\n15. We support global efforts against money laundering and financing of terrorism. However, these efforts have resulted, in part, in unintended consequences for many countries, such as the decline in correspondent banking relationships (CBRs). We encourage the IMF and WBG to continue their efforts to catalyze solutions to address the decline of CBRs, including through a consultative process involving source and destination countries as well as national regulators and global standard‑setters.\\n\\n16. We continue to emphasize the importance of voice and governance reforms in the Bretton Woods Institutions to reflect the changed global economic landscape. We look forward to the completion of the IMF 15th General Review of Quotas, including agreement on a new quota formula, by the Spring Meetings of 2019 and no later than the Annual Meetings of 2019. We are concerned with the slow progress to date and call on the IMFC to seek consensus for its timely completion. We reiterate our call for a revised quota formula that increases the weight of GDP PPP within the GDP blend and further shifts quota shares from advanced economies to dynamic EMDEs. The realignment must not come at the expense of other EMDEs and should protect the quota shares and voice of all PRGT‑eligible countries and small developing states. We reiterate our calls for completing the implementation of the 2010 IMF Governance Reform on Board representation, and for a third Chair for Sub‑Saharan Africa to enhance the voice and representation of the region without this being at the expense of another EMDE Chair.\\n\\n17. We welcome the approval of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) capital increase resolutions and encourage all countries to approve the International Finance Corporation (IFC) capital increase resolutions in a timely manner. It is essential for the WBG to engage effectively with all client countries to maximize development impact. The new IBRD shareholding structure will not lead to a notable change in the voice of EMDEs in IBRD governance. For the IBRD shareholding review scheduled in 2020, we strongly encourage outcomes that uphold the Istanbul Principle to achieve equitable voting power over time between developed countries and developing and transition countries.\\n\\n18. We look forward to the effective implementation of IDA18, which should substantially increase assistance to LICs and deliver on its five themes, including jobs and economic transformation. We welcome the intention to scale up IBRD financing to IDA graduates and strongly urge the elimination of the accelerated payments clause for IDA graduates. Upon graduating from IDA, these countries often have large financing gaps that cannot be filled by borrowing from IBRD and other creditors. Eliminating this clause will contribute to a successful exit from IDA by alleviating the financial burden on graduating countries as they transition to non‑concessional borrowing.\\n\\n19. Finally, we call on the IMF and the WBG to strengthen their efforts toward addressing the severe under‑representation of some regions and countries in recruitment and career progression, including at the managerial levels. We reiterate the importance of staff diversity and gender balance at all levels, including the diversity of educational institutions and backgrounds.\\n\\nLIST OF PARTICIPANTS[1]\\n\\nMinisters of the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development held their one-hundredth meeting in Bali, Indonesia on October 11, 2018 with Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Sri Lanka in the Chair; Julio Velarde, President of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, serving as First Vice-Chair; and Yaw Osafo-Maafo, Senior Minister of the Republic of Ghana, Ghana as Second Vice-Chair.\\n\\nThe meeting of the Ministers was preceded on October 10, 2018 by the one hundred and twelfth meeting of the Deputies of the Group of Twenty-Four, with P.

There's a housing crunch so severe that rents are up 30 percent in the last year alone.\\n\\nThis boom is engulfing the rest of West Texas, extending to areas that drilling hasn't touched before. As communities welcome new jobs and business, they're struggling with an onslaught of problems from spikes in traffic accidents to student homelessness.\\n\\nWhat's happening is unprecedented. In December, companies in the Permian Basin -- an ancient, oil-rich seabed that spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico -- produced twice as much oil as they had four years earlier, during the last boom. Forecasters expect production to double again by 2023.\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and others say the drilling spree is ushering in a new era of American energy independence, but American demand isn't driving it. Foreign demand is.\\n\\nIn late 2015, Congress cut a deal to lift 40-year-old restrictions on the export of crude oil. Three years later, the U.S. has surpassed Russia as the world's top oil producer. The International Energy Agency predicts that American oil -- mostly from the Permian -- will account for 80 percent of the growth in global supply through 2025. That's good for corporate profits but bad for air quality in places with heavy drilling. It also threatens to exacerbate climate change.\\n\\n__\\n\\nThis story is part of a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Texas Tribune, The Associated Press and Newsy.\\n\\n__\\n\\nHydraulic fracturing -- better known as fracking -- made this boom technologically possible, but exports are the reason there's so much new drilling. U.S. refineries built for heavier varieties of oil than the Permian produces can't handle the enormous new quantities of Texas light crude. Instead, companies are shipping it abroad.\\n\\nThe lifting of export restrictions \\\"is tantamount to one of the most important things that's ever been done for the industry,\\\" said Tim Dove, chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources, based near Dallas.\\n\\nBut the country is not \\\"energy independent\\\" in the way most Americans would conceive of the idea. Nor can anyone promise that America, as Abbott put it in a recent tweet, \\\"will NEVER AGAIN depend on Foreign Oil Cartels for energy.\\\"\\n\\nThat's because the U.S. is still importing oil: 1.4 billion barrels in the first half of this year alone, a third of it from the foreign oil cartel known as OPEC.\\n\\nThe country will keep buying oil from other nations indefinitely even as it sells more abroad, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts.\\n\\nThe Texas Tribune and the Center for Public Integrity investigated the scope and impacts of energy exports as part of a collaboration with Newsy and The Associated Press.\\n\\nIn Texas, the boom is sending a lot of money into state and local coffers. Oil and gas tax revenue is up more than 50 percent this year. Said James LeBas, a Texas Oil and Gas Association economist: \\\"When oil and gas is doing well, the state is doing well.\\\"\\n\\nStill, climbing production hasn't boosted local tax revenues fast enough to address the problems that come with it, from crowded classrooms to wrecked roads. Schools, police departments and hospitals are struggling to keep employees lured by better-paying oilfield jobs.\\n\\nTexas regulators, long criticized for being too industry-friendly, also aren't aggressively tracking or policing problems that accompany the boom. For example, the Texas portion of the Permian -- roughly the size of Georgia -- has only a few air pollution monitoring stations, leaving residents largely in the dark about what's in the air they breathe.\\n\\nAnd the industry is consuming water in an arid region at an unsustainable rate. Permian Basin operators used eight times as much water to frack and drill last year as they did in 2011.\\n\\nPeople with no say in these decisions are stuck with the consequences, said Coyne Gibson, who lives in a part of the Permian that had little oil and gas activity until a few years ago.\\n\\n\\\"The bitter, cynical way to look at this is, West Texas becomes an extraction colony for the fuel resources for the rest of the world,\\\" said Gibson, a Big Bend Conservation Alliance volunteer who once worked in the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nGlobally, there are major trade-offs, too. Scientists warn this drilling rush almost certainly will worsen climate change by increasing the world's fossil fuel use at a fraught time. They say drastic reductions in greenhouse gases are needed to avoid intensifying climate-linked disasters.\\n\\nTwo massive wildfires in California this summer were among the largest in state history. Record-high temperatures in Japan killed more than 100 people in July. September's Hurricane Florence was the most devastating storm ever to hit the Carolinas, while Texas communities are still struggling to recover from Hurricane Harvey, which shattered U.S. rainfall records last year.\\n\\n\\\"Every additional gigaton of carbon that we produce as a global society carries with it a very real cost,\\\" said Katharine Hayhoe, who directs the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University.\\n\\nMeanwhile, companies are building oil and gas infrastructure meant to last decades -- including more than 8,000 miles of pipeline in Texas alone, enough to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific three times over.\\n\\nThe new infrastructure makes it \\\"very unlikely that we can dramatically curtail fossil fuel use,\\\" said Richard York, an environmental studies and sociology professor at the University of Oregon.\\n\\n__\\n\\n'I JUST HAD TO STOP BREATHING'\\n\\nThe headaches come almost every day. Some mornings Suzanne Franklin wakes with a nose full of dried blood, her voice filled with gravel. Her husband Jim suffers from respiratory problems, too.\\n\\nWhen Franklin moved to Reeves County in 2010, this remote area roughly 100 miles southwest of Midland was a modest oil and gas producer by Texas standards. Now it ranks third in the state for both. Oil production in the county -- which has fewer than 16,000 residents and more land than Delaware -- skyrocketed from 1.6 million barrels in 2010 to more than 60 million last year, the biggest upturn in the Permian.\\n\\nA sign near one of the new wells, less than a mile from the Franklins, warns of the presence of hydrogen sulfide, a contaminant in crude oil and natural gas. In high concentrations it can kill almost instantly; at low levels it can cause chronic illness.\\n\\nA chemical stench hangs in the air here.\\n\\n\\\"When we went past that site yesterday, I could not believe how bad it was,\\\" Suzanne Franklin said in April. \\\"I just had to stop breathing.\\\"\\n\\nComplaints like hers are common among people who live near gas sites, academic research has found. Flares burning off gas spew pollutants that assault the respiratory system.\\n\\nSites flaring natural gas -- a fossil fuel hitchhiker that comes up with the oil here -- are everywhere in the region. From 2016 through May of this year, the Texas Railroad Commission -- which oversees oil and gas production, not railroads -- issued more than 6,300 permits allowing companies to flare in the Permian, compared to 571 in the entire state from 2008 through 2010.\\n\\nRailroad Commission Chairman Christi Craddick thinks the flaring is a shame -- a waste -- but not an urgent reason for a regulatory crackdown. She called the rules sufficient and well-enforced, adding: \\\"Certainty in regulation is important for industry.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to flaring, oil and gas sites release pollutants during \\\"air emission events\\\" -- pollution releases they characterize as unforeseeable, prompted by equipment malfunctions or other problems. If the state agrees they were unavoidable -- and it almost always does -- they don't count against limits established in state permits that companies must obtain.\\n\\n\\\"These are off-the-books -- they're not levels that are authorized in their air pollution permits, but they're happening routinely,\\\" said Ilan Levin, associate director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a research and advocacy group.\\n\\nLast year, businesses in Texas counties atop the Permian reported pumping out 77,000 tons of pollutants during emission events, largely carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. A single gas processing facility in Pecos County reported 103 such events over the 16 months ending in April, or one every five days.\\n\\nYet punishment is rare. A 2017 investigation by The Texas Tribune found that the agency that regulates air pollution, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, hardly ever fines companies when they bust air permit limits. And only four air pollution monitors are stationed in producing areas of the Texas Permian.\\n\\nThe commission said its monitoring and enforcement comply with state and federal law.\\n\\n\\\"Any violations that are documented during TCEQ investigations are addressed using standard agency protocols and are handled consistently statewide,\\\" the agency said in a written statement. It declined to make officials available for interviews.\\n\\n__\\n\\nTHE DESERT'S WATER\\n\\nBalmorhea, population 550, has never been an oil-and-gas hub. It's a tourist destination, thanks to its namesake state park that draws more than 200,000 visitors a year to enjoy the world's largest spring-fed swimming pool -- an acre-plus expanse of blue-green water that pops amid the desert landscape.\\n\\nBut now producers have come for the fossil fuels. Two years ago, Houston-based Apache Corporation announced it had discovered vast oil and gas deposits in the area and leased more than 300,000 acres.\\n\\nWorries about the ancient springs that feed the pool and supply water to Balmorhea and nearby Toyahvale prompted the TCEQ to install a water quality monitoring station in the state park and spawned at least five studies. Apache contributed money for three of them.\\n\\n\\\"We spent considerable time and effort conducting baseline air, water and soil studies and cultural, historical and surface impact assessments before development began,\\\" Apache spokeswoman Castlen Kennedy said in a written statement.\\n\\nThe company promised not to drill within the city limits or the state park, but it isn't waiting for the results of all the studies to exploit its new oil and gas play, known as Alpine High. It plans to drill 5,000 wells in the coming decades.\\n\\nContamination isn't the only water fear. Some worry the industry will use too much in a region already struggling with drought.\\n\\nOil and gas companies consumed nearly 58 billion gallons to frack and drill last year in the entire basin, the consulting firm IHS Markit estimated, far outstripping the 6.8 billion used in 2011. By 2023, that's expected to jump to nearly 130 billion gallons -- 19 times the amount of water Midland used last year.\\n\\nThere isn't a state agency policing groundwater use. That's left to local conservation districts with differing opinions about how much to limit water withdrawals or even whether, in cases involving oil and gas, they have any authority to regulate.\\n\\nAnd substantial parts of West Texas don't have a district: Legally, people in those areas can pull as much water from their property as they can pump.\\n\\nThe consequences of the increased water use are unclear: Major data gaps hinder such investigations, said Bridget Scanlon, a senior research scientist for the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology. For example, the state doesn't require companies to divulge the type of water they're using -- such as fresh or brackish -- for their drilling operations.\\n\\nA 2017 study by researchers at the University of Texas found that more than enough contaminated water, known as \\\"produced water,\\\" was flowing up from oil and gas wells to meet industry demand -- if it had been recycled. Instead, most producers inject it into underground disposal wells, which have been linked to earthquakes.\\n\\nSome Permian producers are now recycling. Apache says it's already reusing 80 percent of its produced water in Alpine High and is aiming for 100 percent.\\n\\nBut the state doesn't require recycling. The Railroad Commission merely tweaked its rules to make the practice easier.\\n\\n\\\"I call it the carrot -- ?not the stick -- ?approach,\\\" said Craddick, the commission's chairman. \\\"Water protection and, frankly, protecting the environment is a priority for us.\\\"\\n\\nToyahvale resident Neta Rhyne thinks that's a complete misrepresentation.\\n\\n\\\"Why are they destroying our beautiful desert oasis to send oil to Asia?\\\" she said.\\n\\n__\\n\\nTHE OVERWHELMING BOOM\\n\\nThe superintendent of Ector County's school district teared up this spring as he talked about problems that have come with the oil boom.\\n\\nStudent enrollment has doubled in six years. Classrooms are overcrowded. Staffers keep leaving for oilfield jobs; the district is a few hundred teachers short and new hires can't find anywhere they can afford to live. Homelessness among students spiked 26 percent last academic year, with more than 2,100 living in shelters, doubling up with other families or otherwise displaced as housing costs outpace wages.\\n\\n\\\"The thing that really keeps me up at night is, are we giving the kids everything they deserve?\\\" then-Superintendent Tom Crowe said in an April interview, a few months before he retired. \\\"I get emotional about it. I've been doing this a long time and every day I worry, is there a kid out there who slips through the cracks?\\\"\\n\\nThe boom is straining communities across the Permian. Midland County has seen rents rise so fast -- 65 percent since 2010 -- that it's now the most expensive place to lease a home in the state, with Ector County close behind, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development figures.\\n\\nThen there's the traffic -- outright frightening in some places as heavy trucks have multiplied. In Winkler County, population 7,600, accidents are up more than 70 percent this year.\\n\\nOil-related traffic is also chewing up pavement on roads and bridges that weren't designed to carry such heavy loads. Texas Department of Transportation data show the increase in traffic brought by the boom has damaged more than 3,000 miles of state highways in Permian counties. The agency has $3.4 billion worth of projects planned for the area over the next decade -- an investment it describes as \\\"historic\\\" -- but, as of the end of July, it estimated that it still needs more than $1.1 billion for repair work and safety upgrades.\\n\\nOil and gas companies, along with firms that serve them, have responded by paying for some road safety projects and providing housing for their workers.\\n\\nAs they confront the boom's downsides, local leaders across the Permian must make educated guesses about the best ways to respond, laying their bets on how much Permian oil and gas the world will snap up -- and for how long.\\n\\nCraddick, the Railroad Commission chairman who grew up in Midland, said no one can predict a boom's duration, but \\\"I don't think that this is going away in a generation or more.\\\"\\n\\nThe city at the center of the export boom is trying to settle in for the long haul. Leaders have choices to make -- uncomfortable ones.\\n\\nIn April, Midland City Council members looked tortured as they discussed a new drainage fee based on how much concrete covers a property -- common in Texas but anathema to this conservative stronghold -- so they could pay for basic city services.\\n\\nThey reluctantly voted in favor.\\n\\nDefending the decision, council member Scott Dufford put into words the fear of every town strapped to a rocket it can't steer, powered by companies selling Permian crude to the world: \\\"If we do nothing, we're going to be in even more trouble in 10 years.\\\"\\n\\n__\\n\\nTexas Tribune journalists Brandon Formby and Chris Essig, and Center for Public Integrity news developer Pratheek Rebala contributed to this article.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Midland, Texas\"","lat":31,"lng":-102,"__v":0}

Excerpts of his remarks are below, and video can be found here.\\n\\nSen. Cornyn helped secure nearly $4 billion in federal appropriations to advance this project in the Bipartisan Budget Act, which was signed into law in February. Today's passage of this authorization provision marks the final Congressional action prior to the USACE and the relevant local governments breaking ground on this project.\\n\\n\\\"This week we are voting and considering an important bipartisan piece of legislation known as America's Water Infrastructure Act, the most sweeping infrastructure package to be considered by Congress this year. It will literally reauthorize billions of dollars of spending for our nation's ports, harbors, and waterways, and it will end wasteful spending on water projects that are no longer necessary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to thank Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper for spearheading this legislation through the Environment and Public Works Committee.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One piece of the bill we'll be voting on this week will be to allow the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite a study on the so-called Coastal Spine that will run up and down portions of the Gulf Coast. This is a new multi-layered system of storm surge and flood mitigation improvements to address our most acute vulnerabilities. The crucial first step is fully funding the proper engineering study, and that's what we're going to do in this bill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to emphasize, this is not just some parochial matter. It's not just something that matters to the City of Houston and the Gulf Coast region.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The second thing this bill does for Texas is to authorize a project from an area known as the Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay. Across more than 4,000 square miles of South Texas, this bill will update the levee system and in some cases construct new ones in order to better protect the area from storms and hurricanes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In places that were dramatically affected by Hurricane Harvey like Clear Creek and Brays Bayou, funds will be used to widen channels, construct detention basins, replace bridges, and renovate dams.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As Texas communities continue to rebuild from Hurricane Harvey and prepare for future storms, it's critical we take these steps to ensure the coastal region can better withstand major weather events.

But behind...\"","body":"\"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- In a kingdom once ruled by an ever-aging rotation of elderly monarchs, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stands out as the youthful face of a youthful nation. But behind the carefully calibrated public-relations campaign pushing images of the smiling prince meeting with the world's top leaders and business executives lurks a darker side.\\n\\nLast year, at age 31, Mohammed became the kingdom's crown prince, next in line to the throne now held by his octogenarian father, King Salman. While pushing for women to drive, he has overseen the arrest of women's rights activists. While calling for foreign investment, he has imprisoned businessmen, royals and others in a crackdown on corruption that soon resembled a shakedown of the kingdom's most powerful people.\\n\\nAs Saudi defense minister from the age of 29, he pursued a war in Yemen against Shiite rebels that began a month after he took the helm and wears on today.\\n\\nWhat the crown prince chooses next likely will affect the world's largest oil producer for decades to come. And as the disappearance and feared death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul may show, the young prince will brook no dissent in reshaping the kingdom in his image.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to waste my time,\\\" he told Time Magazine in a cover story this year. \\\"I am young.\\\"\\n\\nKhashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote several columns for The Washington Post critical of Prince Mohammed, disappeared Oct. 2 on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials have offered no evidence, but say they fear the writer was killed and dismembered by a Saudi team of 15 men -- an operation that, if carried out, would have to have been authorized by the top of the Al Saud monarchy. The kingdom describes the allegation as \\\"baseless,\\\" but has provided no proof that Khashoggi ever left the consulate.\\n\\nFor decades in Saudi Arabia, succession passed down among the dozens of sons of the kingdom's founder, King Abdul-Aziz. And, over time, the sons have grown older and older upon reaching the throne.\\n\\nWhen King Salman took power in January of 2015 and quickly appointed Prince Mohammed as defense minister, it took the kingdom by surprise, especially given the importance of the position and the prince's age.\\n\\nHe was little-known among the many grandchildren of Saudi Arabia's patriarch, a young man educated only in the kingdom who stuck close to his father, who previously served as the governor of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\\n\\nAs defense minister, he entered office facing a crisis in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, which lies south of the kingdom. Shiite rebels known as Houthis had overrun the country's capital, Sanaa, unseating the deeply unpopular government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.\\n\\nWhen Hadi fled and it appeared the country's port city of Aden would fall to the rebels, Saudi Arabia launched a coalition war against the Houthis -- a conflict that soon became a stalemate.\\n\\nThe United Nations estimates 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen's conflict, and activists say that number is likely far higher. It has exacerbated what the U.N. calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with hunger and cholera stalking civilians, worsened by the kingdom's blockade of ports.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition has faced widespread criticism for its airstrikes hitting clinics and marketplaces, which have killed civilians. The Houthis, as well, have indiscriminately used landmines and arrested political opponents.\\n\\nThe coalition says Iran has funneled weapons to the Houthis ranging from small arms to the ballistic missiles now regularly fired into the kingdom, which Iran denies.\\n\\nFor Prince Mohammed, the conflict remains part of what he sees as an existential struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for the future of the Middle East. Asked about Western concerns over civilian casualties, he offers this: \\\"Mistakes happen in all wars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We don't need to have a new Hezbollah in the Arabian Peninsula. This is a red line not only for Saudi Arabia but for the whole world,\\\" the prince recently told Bloomberg, referring to the Iran-allied Shiite militant group and political party dominant in Lebanon.\\n\\nThe prince also found himself involved in the bizarre resignation-by-television address of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who announced he would step down during a visit to the kingdom in November 2017, fueling suspicion he was coerced into doing so.\\n\\nPrince Mohammed's harsh rhetoric extends to likening Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler. He's also hinted Saudi Arabia would be willing to fight Iran in other ways, leading Tehran to link the kingdom to an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz last month that killed at least 24 people killed and wounded more than 60. Both Arab separatists and the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the assault.\\n\\n\\\"We won't wait for the battle to be in Saudi Arabia,\\\" the prince told the Saudi-owned broadcasting company MBC last year. \\\"Instead, we will work so that the battle is for them in Iran, not in Saudi Arabia.\\\"\\n\\nHis aggressive posture against Iran has won the support of U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration, which pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal struck by President Barack Obama, whom the kingdom deeply distrusted.\\n\\nBefore becoming crown prince, Prince Mohammed visited the White House and forged a close relationship with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. The two are believed to be working on the administration's peace plans for Israel and the Palestinians.\\n\\nTrump made Riyadh his first stop overseas as president, a visit complete with Arab pageantry and opulence. Behind the scenes, many analysts believe Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates saw a greenlight to move ahead with the ongoing boycott of Qatar, a small Arabian Peninsula nation, over a political dispute.\\n\\nTrump initially seemed to favor the boycott of Qatar, which is home to al-Udeid Air Base, the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command.\\n\\nTrump's first Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, sought in vain to pressure the Saudis into resolving the spat and complained privately that the ties between the White House and Prince Mohammed were hurting the effort, officials said at the time. Tillerson's dismissal in March and the arrival of Mike Pompeo as Trump's top diplomat markedly reduced the State Department's heat on Saudi Arabia about the detentions of human rights activists, including women, and the conflict in Yemen.\\n\\nDespite the mounting civilian casualties in Yemen, Pompeo certified to Congress in September that Saudi Arabia was taking steps to reduce and limit them, drawing severe condemnations from lawmakers and human rights groups.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia soon embarked on the prince's ambitious proposal to allow women in the ultraconservative Wahhabi nation to drive. The resulting pictures of women in long black abayas behind the wheel represented a public-relations coup for the image-shaping firms employed by the kingdom, as did footage of women attending soccer matches and movie theaters for the first time in decades.\\n\\nBut before women started their engines, a new crackdown emerged: The kingdom rounded up and imprisoned women's rights activists, including reportedly grabbing one woman who was in the neighboring United Arab Emirates.\\n\\nPrince Mohammed has wowed the business world with promises of an initial public offering for the state oil behemoth Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, suggesting it would have a $2 trillion valuation. Stocks markets around the world have pitched having the IPO on their exchanges, but it has been repeatedly delayed.\\n\\nThe young prince has traveled across the U.S. as part of his business pitch, meeting leaders like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.\\n\\nPrince Mohammed also hosted a major business summit at Riyadh's Ritz Carlton, complete with a humanoid robot named Sophia being awarded Saudi citizenship.\\n\\nOnly weeks later, the hotel turned into a luxury prison as part of a mass arrest of businessmen, royals and others orchestrated by Prince Mohammed in a move described as targeting corruption. Those released agreed to sign over some of their assets, however, giving it the feel of a shakedown.\\n\\n\\\"If I have the power and the king has the power to take action against influential people, then you are already fundamentally strong,\\\" Prince Mohammed told CBS earlier this year.\\n\\nFor now, the anger over Khashoggi's disappearance appears to have galvanized international criticism of the young prince, about whom the columnist wrote critically for the Post.\\n\\nTrump, already angry over rising global oil prices, has said he wants answers from Saudi Arabia and suggested Khashoggi's fiancee could visit the White House.\\n\\nProminent American lawmakers also are indignant -- though U.S.-Saudi relations have survived even the 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers being from the kingdom.\\n\\nThe opaqueness of the Al Saud royal family makes it difficult to see what effect the controversy is having on support for Prince Mohammed at home. State television continues to air footage of him attending meetings and greeting officials as if all is normal.\\n\\nAnd as the son of the king, analysts say he has the full protection of the throne's powers.\\n\\nOnce asked if anything could stop him, the prince gave a two-word reply: \\\"Only death.\\\"\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Dubai\"","lat":25,"lng":55,"__v":0}

Beckham said his headbutt was a bit of self-motivation.\\n\\n\\\"I was just trying to get myself going,\\\" he said. \\\"I felt like some of those plays where I was getting myself going was some of my best stuff. So I was just trying to get myself fired up. I did that and it helped me.\\\"\\n\\nBeckham bemoaned the lack of downfield passes from quarterback Eli Manning and the team's subpar energy following a 33-31 loss to Carolina.\\n\\nThe Giants were counting on a prime-time visit from the Super Bowl champs to get their season turned around.\\n\\nInstead, poor pass protection, inconsistent offense and costly penalties have left the Giants reeling.\\n\\nThe Eagles' game plan on Thursday was to contain Beckham. He had six catches for 44 yards and his longest reception was 12 yards.\\n\\nThe Giants' mistakes started early against the Eagles. Manning was intercepted on the opening drive of the game, and they took advantage for a touchdown.\\n\\nLater in the quarter, Manning was sacked at his 1 and the Giants were forced to punt. The Eagles took advantage of the favorable field position and drove for another touchdown and a 14-3.\\n\\nWhen the Giants added a field goal to get within 14-6, the defense allowed a touchdown on the next Eagles possession.\\n\\nThe Eagles, who entered the game at 2-3, had not scored more than 23 points in a game this season entering Thursday.\\n\\nBut they managed 24 in the opening half.\\n\\nThe Giants' offense continued its struggles on third downs. They didn't convert a third down until their opening drive of the second half. It was the first time in 16 tries they converted on third down going back to Week 4. The finished 4 of 14. The Eagles were 9 of 16 on third downs.\\n\\n\\\"They converted on third downs,\\\" Shurmur said. \\\"When you're that good on third downs and you can stay on the field, you can give yourself a chance.\\\"\\n\\nThe biggest bright spot for the Giants was rookie running back Saquon Barkley. He had 13 carries for 130 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown. And he added nine receptions for 99 yards, including a spectacular 55-yarder where he eluded several would-be tacklers. He's the second player in NFL history to gain at least 100 yards from scrimmage in each of his first six career games.\\n\\nHowever, the rest of the Giants' offense struggled as they couldn't consistently sustain long drives.\\n\\n\\\"We beat ourselves.

We can't have that,\\\" Beckham said. \\\"There's no way we're going to beat good teams with doing that.\\\"\\n\\nManning was 24 for 43 for 281 yards and was sacked four times.\\n\\nAnd the Giants have the same record as they did last year when they finished 3-13.

I thought we were going to die.\\\"\\n\\nMishelle McPherson and her ex-husband looked for the elderly mother of a friend on Thursday.

(AP) After last week's last-second loss against Carolina, Giants coach Pat Shurmur said he was ''done'' talking about Odell Beckham Jr. and his critical comments about the team.\\n\\nSix games into his first season, Shurmur still can't shake the OBJ questions. It's talk of a postseason push that's gone silent.\\n\\nThe Giants are 1-5 and in last place in the NFC East after a 34-13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday night that featured Beckham marching to the locker room before the end of the first half and slamming his head into a giant cooling fan during a second-half fit.\\n\\nShurmur said Beckham went to the locker room early because of cramps. Beckham said his headbutt was a bit of self-motivation.\\n\\n''I was just trying to get myself going,'' he said. ''I felt like some of those plays where I was getting myself going was some of my best stuff. So I was just trying to get myself fired up. I did that and it helped me.''\\n\\nBeckham bemoaned the lack of downfield passes from quarterback Eli Manning and the team's subpar energy following a 33-31 loss to Carolina.\\n\\nThe Giants were counting on a prime-time visit from the Super Bowl champs to get their season turned around.\\n\\nInstead, poor pass protection, inconsistent offense and costly penalties have left the Giants reeling.\\n\\nThe Eagles' game plan on Thursday was to contain Beckham. He had six catches for 44 yards and his longest reception was 12 yards.\\n\\nThe Giants' mistakes started early against the Eagles. Manning was intercepted on the opening drive of the game, and they took advantage for a touchdown.\\n\\nLater in the quarter, Manning was sacked at his 1 and the Giants were forced to punt. The Eagles took advantage of the favorable field position and drove for another touchdown and a 14-3.\\n\\nWhen the Giants added a field goal to get within 14-6, the defense allowed a touchdown on the next Eagles possession.\\n\\nThe Eagles, who entered the game at 2-3, had not scored more than 23 points in a game this season entering Thursday.\\n\\nBut they managed 24 in the opening half.\\n\\nThe Giants' offense continued its struggles on third downs. They didn't convert a third down until their opening drive of the second half. It was the first time in 16 tries they converted on third down going back to Week 4. The finished 4 of 14. The Eagles were 9 of 16 on third downs.\\n\\n''They converted on third downs,'' Shurmur said. ''When you're that good on third downs and you can stay on the field, you can give yourself a chance.''\\n\\nThe biggest bright spot for the Giants was rookie running back Saquon Barkley. He had 13 carries for 130 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown. And he added nine receptions for 99 yards, including a spectacular 55-yarder where he eluded several would-be tacklers. He's the second player in NFL history to gain at least 100 yards from scrimmage in each of his first six career games.\\n\\nHowever, the rest of the Giants' offense struggled as they couldn't consistently sustain long drives.\\n\\n''We beat ourselves. Every time I looked up I felt like there was a yellow flag somewhere. We can't have that,'' Beckham said. ''There's no way we're going to beat good teams with doing that.''\\n\\nManning was 24 for 43 for 281 yards and was sacked four times.\\n\\nAnd the Giants have the same record as they did last year when they finished 3-13. And they have to wait to make up any ground since they don't play again until facing the Atlanta Falcons on Monday, Oct. 22.\\n\\n''1-5 is not where we want to be. I'm not happy about it, and I'm frustrated like everybody,'' Manning said. ''All we can do is worry about the next game.''\\n\\n---\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP-NFL\\n\\nRecent NFL Discussions early college football play on Fri, Oct 2018 by shawnsushiCOLL AND PRO FOOTBALL FOR THURS on Thu, Oct 2018 by Timmy1961Thursday Night Ice on Thu, Oct 2018 by JBoppaCarolina Wise Guy NFL and CFB Selections 10/11! on Thu, Oct 2018 by CarolinaWiseGuyFree NCAAFB, NFL \u0026 MLB Premium Service Plays For Thursday 10/11/18 on Thu, Oct 2018 by Shazman Forum Home | More Football Discussion\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"East Rutherford, New Jersey\"","lat":40,"lng":-74,"__v":0}

''NFC East and the conference. It's huge. Being 3-3 is better than 2-4. This is more like who we are.

Passes of 17 to Jeffery and 14 to Clement set up Clement's touchdown run.\\n\\nA spectacular tackle-breaking run by Barkley on a 55-yard screen pass helped cut the lead to 14-6 in the second quarter but Wentz hit a wide-open Nelson Agholer on a third and 3 and connected with Ertz for a 21-6 lead on the next play.\\n\\nElliott made it 24-6 just before halftime and Philadelphia put the game out of reach with a 75-yard drive that ended with a short Jeffery TD catch.\\n\\n''We didn't do anything well enough to win tonight,'' Giants coach Pat Shurmur said.

The Giants had LB Ray Ray Amstrong (concussion), WR Cody Latimer (hamstring) and CB Antonio Hamilton (illness) leave the game.\\n\\nBARKLEY GAINS: Barkley has gained at least 100 yards from scrimmage in each of his first six career games.

In 2014, 15-20 inmates participated.\\n\\nAdamson said that in 2013 the program generated $33,000 and the numbers have dropped steadily. So far this year only $6,000 has been generated. \\\"There is no program,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdamson referred to a letter he had written, which was included in the agenda packets. He asked how many inmates applied for work release in 2017 and how many were then denied.\\n\\nHe also asked if the policies and procedures put in place for the program need to be reviewed and revised, especially in regards to drug testing.\\n\\nIn doing the review, Adamson said he spoke with the district magistrates who regularly recommend work release for inmates and were surprised how many were denied.\\n\\nHe suggested that basing the decision on drug tests administered just as inmates are entering the jail could be preventing willing people from participating in the program.\\n\\nWarden Gregory Collins reported that often people who come to the jail either don't have a job, or lose their job shortly after. He said they have several employers they work with who will provide jobs for inmates, but that has become problematic.\\n\\nFor example, one inmate they helped to get clean and get a job, but once she was released from the jail, she didn't show up for work anymore, making the employer wary of offering work to an inmate again. He said work release issues are a problem for other jails as well.\\n\\nPresident Judge Fredric Ammerman added that they cannot tell how long ago a drug was taken either. The drug tests at the jail test for 11 substances, but to determine how \\\"old\\\" that substance in the blood is requires the samples to be sent to an outside laboratory. How long the drug remains in the system also depends on the drug and the amount taken. Collins said he has seen marijuana last up to 90 days.\\n\\nAfter considerable discussion, the board agreed to have the personnel committee review the procedures, which have not been updated since 2002, and revisit the matter.\\n\\nIn July CCJ began with 167 inmates with 149 committed, 152 released and ending with 166. There were 29 on home detention.\\n\\nAugust began with 166 with 152 committed, 149 released and ending with 168 and 26 on home detention. September began with 168, with 158 committed, 161 released and ending with 165 and 18 on home detention. Currently 14 are housed in Jefferson County and one in Centre County.\\n\\nThe board discussed again the issues with population and expenses. Ammerman said he and Judge Paul Cherry have packed schedules and the problem stems from the methadone and opioid epidemic, which affects every aspect of life, including a rise in Children and Youth Services cases and other home problems.\\n\\nAt this time, meth is an even bigger problem than opioids with marijuana and alcohol taking something of a back seat, though they are still a problem as well.\\n\\n\\\"I don't envy your job to try to find the money (for the budget),\\\" he said to the commissioners regarding the budget.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc0301915ee281f201b4c25"},"title":"\"Opinion | Angela Merkel Could Save Europe. Why Won't She?\"","body":"\"BERLIN -- Campaigning in the spring of 2017, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany declared at a packed beer hall in Bavaria that it was time for Europe to \\\"take its destiny into its own hands.\\\" In the face of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Hungary's slide into illiberalism and an American president who viewed the European Union with disdain, Europe, she argued, needed a leader who could push forward reform and push back against its detractors. Ms. Merkel vowed that she was ready to be that leader.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in the 18 months since, Ms. Merkel has failed to fulfill that pledge. The European Union's promise to form an \\\"ever closer union\\\" seems more like an empty slogan than a strategy these days. But further integration is necessary. With Europe besieged by illiberal forces inside (Hungary) and from outside (Vladimir Putin's Russia), and voters electing anti-European Union populists, leaders across the Continent need to demonstrate that they are confident about Europe's shared future. Ms. Merkel clearly understands this -- but she isn't helping Europe to do anything about it.\\n\\nMs. Merkel's troubles started with the September 2017 election, when her party, the center-right Christian Democrats, and the center-left Social Democrats lost a stunningly large number of voters to the far-right Alternative for Germany. The message was clear: Enthusiasm for Ms. Merkel was waning. It then took the parties more than four months to form a government. Once a coalition was finally established in March, the hope among many pro-European policymakers was that Ms. Merkel would find her footing and return to the European agenda that she had highlighted during the campaign.\\n\\nMembers of her own team have made that difficult. Her interior minister and the Social Democrats' leader, Horst Seehofer, nearly brought down the entire government last summer when he threatened to resign over Ms. Merkel's relatively open immigration policies. That crisis was averted, but Mr. Seehofer continues to contradict and challenge the chancellor. And he isn't the only one. Last month, Ms. Merkel's own party ousted Volker Kauder, one of her closest allies in the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. \\\"The Merkel era is officially over,\\\" a journalist friend of mine texted me when the news broke.\\n\\nBut blaming domestic politics for Ms. Merkel's failure to push for further European integration misses a bigger story. Over the last year, she's delivered several lofty speeches about the need to maintain European Union unity and protect open societies. But she's said little about how those broad aims translate into actual policies.\\n\\nHer actions stand in marked contrast to those of President Emmanuel Macron of France. Whereas Ms. Merkel lacks concrete ideas, Mr. Macron oozes them. Since he was elected last year, he has proposed dozens of ways to deepen European integration: the creation of a European Union finance minister, a joint military force, a eurozone budget, a European intelligence agency and a common asylum policy -- to name just a few.\\n\\nMs. Merkel's response to this tsunami of ideas has been lukewarm at best. The two met in France this summer and agreed in very broad terms to begin work on a eurozone budget, something Ms. Merkel once strongly opposed. Many analysts initially described it as a breakthrough -- until eight other eurozone members came forward to reject the idea. For Mr. Macron, always willing to buck conventional thinking, the opposition was no reason to slow down. For Ms. Merkel, the ultimate consensus builder, it was a major roadblock.\\n\\nMs. Merkel, who is a big fan of public polling, has also no doubt noted the rising opposition to Mr. Macron's ideas inside Germany (and, indeed, inside France, where Mr. Macron's popularity has plummeted). Germans may have fallen madly in love with Mr. Macron during his election campaign but that love affair is fading. Today, Germans complain about a \\\"Macron hangover\\\" often in tandem with \\\"Europe fatigue.\\\" There's a sense in Germany that Berlin will ultimately pick up the tab for any deeper European integration. Germans feel like they already paid to save Europe once, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. They don't want to do it again.\\n\\nUnderstanding all this, Ms. Merkel will continue to nod politely when Mr. Macron presents innovative proposals, but she's not going to grab his outstretched hand. That approach will certainly prevent Germany from paying more, at least in the short term, and could possibly save her political career.\\n\\nBut Ms. Merkel needs to ask herself about the long-term costs of failure: How much does Germany stand to lose if the European project continues to falter, if the French-German engine stalls and, when European leaders meet this month, they fail to produce fresh thinking? Deeper European integration and a demonstration of faith in Europe's common values and its common fate are necessary to keep the populist tide at bay. If Mr. Macron loses the battle that he is waging against Viktor Orban's illiberal Hungary, Germany will surely pay a price sooner or later.\\n\\nIn her final term in office, Ms. Merkel needs to summon the courage to work with Mr. Macron to lift the European Union out of its existential crisis by making good on some of the French president's proposals. The future of Europe depends on it.\\n\\nJulianne Smith (@Julie_C_Smith) is a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden and now is a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Berlin\"","lat":52,"lng":13,"__v":0}

Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who exchanges phone and text messages with the young crown prince, was instrumental in last year's deal to sell $110 billion in U.S. weapons to the kingdom.\\n\\nBut even before Khashoggi vanished, concerns were mounting in Congress over Saudi Arabia's policies and the crown prince's aggressive steps to silence his critics. And now there are calls on Capitol Hill for the U.S. to halt arms sales to the kingdom, and Khashoggi's disappearance could galvanize more opposition from lawmakers and pressure Trump to rethink his relations with Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nTrump on Thursday pronounced U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia \\\"excellent\\\" and said he doesn't want to scuttle arms deals with Riyadh because it means tens of millions of dollars pouring into the U.S. economy. He said the kingdom would simply buy the weapons from Russia or China instead.\\n\\n\\\"If it turns out to be as bad as it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling this situation,\\\" he said without elaborating.\\n\\nMuch of how the U.S. responds will depend on whether evidence surfaces that proves Saudi Arabia is responsible for Khashoggi's death.\\n\\nTrump will have to craft a \\\"calibrated response,\\\" said Jon Alterman, who directs the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\\"He doesn't like that approach. The president likes complete wins.\\\"\\n\\nThe close ties between the Trump White House and the kingdom were in part forged by a friendship between two young princes: Last spring, Kushner and the crown prince met formally for the first time as a late-season snow fell outside the White House.\\n\\nThe two men -- both in their 30s, both trusted aides of older, familial leaders -- struck a bond. As their countries' chief negotiators on Israeli-Palestinian peace, Kushner and the Saudi prince were both looking to make a name for themselves on the world stage and consulted with each other frequently over the following months.\\n\\nKushner championed Crown Prince Mohammed to the president and senior foreign policy officials, some of whom expressed wariness at the embrace of MBS, as he is known in diplomatic circles.\\n\\nThe two men's relationship also played a key role in Riyadh becoming the unlikely first stop on Trump's maiden international trip in May 2017. Trump, despite endorsing a travel ban on Muslims during his campaign, became the first U.S. president to make his official first trip to an Islamic nation.\\n\\nRelations between the two countries are complex because they are entwined on energy, military, economic and intelligence issues. The Trump administration has aggressively courted the Saudis for support of its Middle East agenda to counter Iranian influence, fight extremism and forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\\n\\n\\\"We want to have a relationship with Saudi Arabia. They're a strategic partner. They're a mortal enemy of the Iranians. They're helping us on terrorism,\\\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump supporter and top member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\\n\\n\\\"Having said all that, if this did happen -- and it's increasingly likely that something bad happened to this man at the hands of the Saudi government -- that shows contempt for us. That's disrespectful to us. It puts people like me in a box who've been one of the leading champions of the relationship.\\\"\\n\\nIt's not just Graham who's in a box. It's also Trump, who has long-standing business ties to Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nJeff Prescott, who was senior director for the Middle East at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that a reassessment of the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia is overdue and that Trump should raise U.S. complaints with Saudi leaders.\\n\\n\\\"What the Trump administration has given Saudi Arabia is a green light to pursue any policy,\\\" said Prescott, now executive director of National Security Action, a group of former officials opposed to the Trump administration. \\\"The key question is whether Republicans will have the courage to force the administration to have a reckoning of the relationship.\\\"\\n\\nHe said Kushner's project to forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians also could be in jeopardy.\\n\\n\\\"There is no question that a rift with Saudi Arabia -- or even relations strained by pressure from Congress -- would make an already bleak prospect even less likely,\\\" Prescott said.\\n\\nIn Congress, there is a push for sanctions under a human rights law, and lawmakers are questioning American support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. The U.S. has raised concerns previously about heavy civilian casualties caused by the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.\\n\\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., voiced doubt there would be support in Congress for another arms sale to Saudi Arabia -- though lawmakers haven't blocked sales before. He also called for at least a temporary halt in U.S. military support for the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen. Murphy tweeted that if Saudi Arabia is found complicit in Khashoggi's death, it should be viewed as a \\\"fundamental break in our relationship with Saudi Arabia.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington, D.C.\"","lat":38,"lng":-77,"__v":0}

(AP) -- After last week's last-second loss against Carolina, Giants coach Pat Shurmur said he was \\\"done\\\" talking about Odell Beckham Jr. and his critical comments about the team.\\n\\nSix games into his first season, Shurmur still can't shake the OBJ questions. It's talk of a postseason push that's gone silent.\\n\\nThe Giants are 1-5 and in last place in the NFC East after a 34-13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday night that featured Beckham marching to the locker room before the end of the first half and slamming his head into a giant cooling fan during a second-half fit.\\n\\nShurmur said Beckham went to the locker room early because of cramps. Beckham said his headbutt was a bit of self-motivation.\\n\\n\\\"I was just trying to get myself going,\\\" he said. \\\"I felt like some of those plays where I was getting myself going was some of my best stuff. So I was just trying to get myself fired up. I did that and it helped me.\\\"\\n\\nBeckham bemoaned the lack of downfield passes from quarterback Eli Manning and the team's subpar energy following a 33-31 loss to Carolina.\\n\\nThe Giants were counting on a prime-time visit from the Super Bowl champs to get their season turned around.\\n\\nInstead, poor pass protection, inconsistent offense and costly penalties have left the Giants reeling.\\n\\nThe Eagles' game plan on Thursday was to contain Beckham. He had six catches for 44 yards and his longest reception was 12 yards.\\n\\nThe Giants' mistakes started early against the Eagles. Manning was intercepted on the opening drive of the game, and they took advantage for a touchdown.\\n\\nLater in the quarter, Manning was sacked at his 1 and the Giants were forced to punt. The Eagles took advantage of the favorable field position and drove for another touchdown and a 14-3.\\n\\nWhen the Giants added a field goal to get within 14-6, the defense allowed a touchdown on the next Eagles possession.\\n\\nThe Eagles, who entered the game at 2-3, had not scored more than 23 points in a game this season entering Thursday.\\n\\nBut they managed 24 in the opening half.\\n\\nThe Giants' offense continued its struggles on third downs. They didn't convert a third down until their opening drive of the second half. It was the first time in 16 tries they converted on third down going back to Week 4. The finished 4 of 14. The Eagles were 9 of 16 on third downs.\\n\\n\\\"They converted on third downs,\\\" Shurmur said. \\\"When you're that good on third downs and you can stay on the field, you can give yourself a chance.\\\"\\n\\nThe biggest bright spot for the Giants was rookie running back Saquon Barkley. He had 13 carries for 130 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown. And he added nine receptions for 99 yards, including a spectacular 55-yarder where he eluded several would-be tacklers. He's the second player in NFL history to gain at least 100 yards from scrimmage in each of his first six career games.\\n\\nHowever, the rest of the Giants' offense struggled as they couldn't consistently sustain long drives.\\n\\n\\\"We beat ourselves. Every time I looked up I felt like there was a yellow flag somewhere. We can't have that,\\\" Beckham said. \\\"There's no way we're going to beat good teams with doing that.\\\"\\n\\nManning was 24 for 43 for 281 yards and was sacked four times.\\n\\nAnd the Giants have the same record as they did last year when they finished 3-13. And they have to wait to make up any ground since they don't play again until facing the Atlanta Falcons on Monday, Oct. 22.\\n\\n\\\"1-5 is not where we want to be. I'm not happy about it, and I'm frustrated like everybody,\\\" Manning said. \\\"All we can do is worry about the next game.\\\"\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"East Rutherford, New Jersey\"","lat":40,"lng":-74,"__v":0}

He described the place as a \\\"good family resort town\\\" that attracts visitors seeking peace and quiet rather than the spring break-like atmosphere of other communities along the 200-mile (320-kilometer) Florida Panhandle.\\n\\nMore than a third of the population of Mexico Beach is 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census, and nearly half of the housing is for seasonal or recreational use.\\n\\nMost of the full-time residents, LaFountain said, have some connection to the hospitality industry. Some operate vacation home rentals, while others work jobs cleaning and maintaining the homes. Others own or work in restaurants, rent out kayaks or run charter fishing boats. LaFountain himself has a lawn-mowing business.\\n\\nDespite the widespread destruction, LaFountain said he believes most people will rebuild.\\n\\n\\\"I think the people here have a great heart and a lot of resilience. We call them stubborn and hard-headed. I think they will be back,\\\" LaFountain said in a phone interview while driving back to Mexico Beach.\\n\\nMexico Beach is on the west end of what is sometimes called Florida's Forgotten Coast, so named because it is not heavily developed like many of the state's other shoreline areas, with their lavish homes and high-rise condos and hotels.\\n\\nU.S. Route 98 runs right along the coast, where a few beachside restaurants offer oysters and other seafood, cocktails and a view of the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nBob Tenbrunesel's home in Mexico Beach was damaged but not destroyed. On Thursday, he rode around town in the back of a pickup truck, surveying the damage. It was upsetting to see all of the places that he loved destroyed: Toucan's Bar and Grill, Killer Seafood, Cathey's Hardware and Tackle.\\n\\nTamara Lush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida; Brendan Farrington from Tallahassee, Florida; and Curt Anderson from Miami.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Mexico Beach, Florida\"","lat":29,"lng":-85,"__v":0}

(AP) -- After last week's last-second loss against Carolina, Giants coach Pat Shurmur said he was \\\"done\\\" talking about Odell Beckham Jr. and his critical comments about the team.\\n\\nSix games into his first season, Shurmur still can't shake the OBJ questions. It's talk of a postseason push that's gone silent.\\n\\nThe Giants are 1-5 and in last place in the NFC East after a 34-13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday night that featured Beckham marching to the locker room before the end of the first half and slamming his head into a giant cooling fan during a second-half fit.\\n\\nShurmur said Beckham went to the locker room early because of cramps. Beckham said his headbutt was a bit of self-motivation.\\n\\n\\\"I was just trying to get myself going,\\\" he said. \\\"I felt like some of those plays where I was getting myself going was some of my best stuff. So I was just trying to get myself fired up. I did that and it helped me.\\\"\\n\\nBeckham bemoaned the lack of downfield passes from quarterback Eli Manning and the team's subpar energy following a 33-31 loss to Carolina.\\n\\nThe Giants were counting on a prime-time visit from the Super Bowl champs to get their season turned around.\\n\\nInstead, poor pass protection, inconsistent offense and costly penalties have left the Giants reeling.\\n\\nThe Eagles' game plan on Thursday was to contain Beckham. He had six catches for 44 yards and his longest reception was 12 yards.\\n\\nThe Giants' mistakes started early against the Eagles. Manning was intercepted on the opening drive of the game, and they took advantage for a touchdown.\\n\\nLater in the quarter, Manning was sacked at his 1 and the Giants were forced to punt. The Eagles took advantage of the favorable field position and drove for another touchdown and a 14-3.\\n\\nWhen the Giants added a field goal to get within 14-6, the defense allowed a touchdown on the next Eagles possession.\\n\\nThe Eagles, who entered the game at 2-3, had not scored more than 23 points in a game this season entering Thursday.\\n\\nBut they managed 24 in the opening half.\\n\\nThe Giants' offense continued its struggles on third downs. They didn't convert a third down until their opening drive of the second half. It was the first time in 16 tries they converted on third down going back to Week 4. The finished 4 of 14. The Eagles were 9 of 16 on third downs.\\n\\n\\\"They converted on third downs,\\\" Shurmur said. \\\"When you're that good on third downs and you can stay on the field, you can give yourself a chance.\\\"\\n\\nThe biggest bright spot for the Giants was rookie running back Saquon Barkley. He had 13 carries for 130 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown. And he added nine receptions for 99 yards, including a spectacular 55-yarder where he eluded several would-be tacklers. He's the second player in NFL history to gain at least 100 yards from scrimmage in each of his first six career games.\\n\\nHowever, the rest of the Giants' offense struggled as they couldn't consistently sustain long drives.\\n\\n\\\"We beat ourselves. Every time I looked up I felt like there was a yellow flag somewhere. We can't have that,\\\" Beckham said. \\\"There's no way we're going to beat good teams with doing that.\\\"\\n\\nManning was 24 for 43 for 281 yards and was sacked four times.\\n\\nAnd the Giants have the same record as they did last year when they finished 3-13.

Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who exchanges phone and text messages with the young crown prince, was instrumental in last year's deal to sell $110 billion in U.S. weapons to the kingdom.\\n\\nBut even before Khashoggi vanished, concerns were mounting in Congress over Saudi Arabia's policies and the crown prince's aggressive steps to silence his critics. And now there are calls on Capitol Hill for the U.S. to halt arms sales to the kingdom, and Khashoggi's disappearance could galvanize more opposition from lawmakers and pressure Trump to rethink his relations with Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nTrump on Thursday pronounced U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia \\\"excellent\\\" and said he doesn't want to scuttle arms deals with Riyadh because it means tens of millions of dollars pouring into the U.S. economy. He said the kingdom would simply buy the weapons from Russia or China instead.\\n\\n\\\"If it turns out to be as bad as it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling this situation,\\\" he said without elaborating.\\n\\nMuch of how the U.S. responds will depend on whether evidence surfaces that proves Saudi Arabia is responsible for Khashoggi's death.\\n\\nTrump will have to craft a \\\"calibrated response,\\\" said Jon Alterman, who directs the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\\"He doesn't like that approach.

As their countries' chief negotiators on Israeli-Palestinian peace, Kushner and the Saudi prince were both looking to make a name for themselves on the world stage and consulted with each other frequently over the following months.\\n\\nKushner championed Crown Prince Mohammed to the president and senior foreign policy officials, some of whom expressed wariness at the embrace of MBS, as he is known in diplomatic circles.\\n\\nThe two men's relationship also played a key role in Riyadh becoming the unlikely first stop on Trump's maiden international trip in May 2017. Trump, despite endorsing a travel ban on Muslims during his campaign, became the first U.S. president to make his official first trip to an Islamic nation.\\n\\nRelations between the two countries are complex because they are entwined on energy, military, economic and intelligence issues. The Trump administration has aggressively courted the Saudis for support of its Middle East agenda to counter Iranian influence, fight extremism and forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\\n\\n\\\"We want to have a relationship with Saudi Arabia.

It's also Trump, who has long-standing business ties to Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nJeff Prescott, who was senior director for the Middle East at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that a reassessment of the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia is overdue and that Trump should raise U.S. complaints with Saudi leaders.\\n\\n\\\"What the Trump administration has given Saudi Arabia is a green light to pursue any policy,\\\" said Prescott, now executive director of National Security Action, a group of former officials opposed to the Trump administration. \\\"The key question is whether Republicans will have the courage to force the administration to have a reckoning of the relationship.\\\"\\n\\nHe said Kushner's project to forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians also could be in jeopardy.\\n\\n\\\"There is no question that a rift with Saudi Arabia -- or even relations strained by pressure from Congress -- would make an already bleak prospect even less likely,\\\" Prescott said.\\n\\nIn Congress, there is a push for sanctions under a human rights law, and lawmakers are questioning American support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. The U.S. has raised concerns previously about heavy civilian casualties caused by the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.\\n\\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., voiced doubt there would be support in Congress for another arms sale to Saudi Arabia -- though lawmakers haven't blocked sales before.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc0301915ee281f201b4c33"},"title":"\"Kentucky's PJ Washington confident, poised to lead Wildcats\"","body":"\"LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- PJ Washington flashed a wide, sly grin when asked about plans to make his second season at Kentucky better than the first.\\n\\nIt spoke volumes about his confidence before he said a word.\\n\\nBut the 6-foot-8 forward does plan to be more vocal. He returns to school as the top scorer and rebounder for the Wildcats. Washington also wants to prove he can defend all positions, perhaps the most important advice he received last spring from NBA scouts while testing the draft waters.\\n\\nAn injured left pinkie that bothered Washington last season has healed following offseason surgery. Fully healthy, his focus now is applying lessons learned from a busy summer to a team that will look to him for leadership.\\n\\n\\\"I just came back to get better, honestly,\\\" Washington said Thursday at Kentucky's media day. \\\"I knew my role was going to be bigger, so I just came back to just try to be a leader and I feel like I'm doing a great job right now.\\\"\\n\\nOne of a handful of Wildcats who entered the NBA draft after last season, Washington's decision after the combine to return for his sophomore season was significant for coach John Calipari's squad. Washington's 10.8 points and 5.7 rebounds per game as a freshman provide a good base for Kentucky, which returns 32 percent of its offense from the 26-11 squad that reached the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16.\\n\\nThough Calipari would welcome improved numbers, he'd also like more consistency from Washington. The coach used a golf swing analogy, attributing successful tee shots to having the same motion. Scouts liked what they saw from his game in general, but noted that he needs to make it a habit on both ends of the floor.\\n\\n\\\"Here's what they loved,\\\" Calipari said of Washington. \\\"They loved his body. They loved his motion and movement. They loved his competitive spirit. Now they're saying he's got to get more consistent skill-wise. There's one way to do that, and that's getting in the gym.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dallas native has needed no motivation there. After being a spectator for part of the summer while recovering from surgery, he has thrown himself into training and added muscle to 228-pound frame.\\n\\nAs for that troublesome pinkie, Washington said it was bent at an awkward angle and painful -- but now he's good to go. While he said it didn't affect his shooting -- his 52 percent accuracy was second on the team -- he acknowledged the injury affected how he grabbed rebounds.\\n\\nWashington showed no effects from the injury during Kentucky's August tour in the Bahamas, where he averaged 14.5 points and 7.5 boards in four games.\\n\\n\\\"It's straight now,\\\" Washington said. \\\"Definitely a lot better than what it was.\\\"\\n\\nWashington now looks forward to being a better rebounder, a daunting scenario for opponents considering Kentucky has a stacked frontcourt. Besides returning 6-11 Nick Richards (5.1 points, 4.4 rebounds), the Wildcats added 6-8 fifth-year senior Reid Travis from Stanford and 6-10 freshman EJ Montgomery.\\n\\nFor Washington, it is all starting on the defensive end. He's not only embracing that challenge, but enjoying it.\\n\\n\\\"He's more confident, more relaxed on the court,\\\" Richards said. \\\"He's got a lot to do, playing 1 through 5 defensively on the court. He's the vocal leader on the team and gets on everybody when they're not doing something they're supposed to be doing. He was like that last year, but he's doing more of it this year.\\\"\\n\\nWashington's goal remains playing in the NBA, but he doesn't regret returning to Kentucky. After his freshman year was a blur in many areas, he's making sure to savor every minute of college life and especially basketball.\\n\\nOn-court minutes are definitely there as Calipari seeks a catalyst, a role Washington is eager to fulfill after a summer of learning.\\n\\n\\\"The Bahamas helped me play my game on a different level,\\\" he said. \\\"It helped me showing energy on both ends of the floor and being able to step out on the perimeter.\\n\\n\\\"I feel like I did a better job than last year and I'm going to try to continue to build off that.\\\"\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Gary B.

The result: a 124-76 win for the home team.\\n\\nAgainst an overmatched opponent from across the world, the Clippers' focus was on refining sets, building on-court chemistry - and being safe about it, Coach Doc Rivers said.\\n\\n\\\"We don't really do a lot of scouting about the other team right now, we just really work on our stuff - we work on our base defense and our base offense and just play the game,\\\" Rivers said. \\\"When we played Denver the other night, or the Lakers, we were more concerned about how we played.

At that point, Rivers reinserted the starters to extend that advantage to 70-35 at intermission.\\n\\nThe 7-foot-3 Marjanovic continued to his nearly untouchable preseason play, with 14 of his game-high scoring total coming in the first half.

Yelich's paternal grandfather was Serbian.\\n\\n\\\"Everybody is seriously super-stoked and really happy,\\\" said Sinisa Torbica, 50, whose parents immigrated to Milwaukee from Serbia in the 1960s.\\n\\nTorbica, who makes a living as a translator, said he long thought Yelich might be of Serbian descent but wasn't sure because the Americanized spelling differs from the more usual Jelic surname. Torbica said it was \\\"fricking awesome\\\" when a friend told him about Yelich's ancestry last year. His own friends, he said, feel the same.\\n\\n\\\"They're just kind of like awestruck,\\\" Torbica said. \\\"They're like, 'Wow, I can't believe it. He's Serbian, are you kidding me? MVP?' It's unbelievable.\\\"\\n\\nYelich said he has never visited Serbia or fully researched his heritage, but he feels \\\"pride in it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Any time you can have an impact on anybody's life in a positive direction, to bring happiness to the community or a certain group of people, you don't take that lightly as a team, as a player,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe Brewers acquired Yelich from the Miami Marlins in a trade this past offseason and he went on to win the National League batting title with a .326 average. He hit 36 home runs and had 110 RBIs, just missing the Triple Crown -- a rare feat last accomplished by Miguel Cabrera for Detroit in 2012.\\n\\nNow, Yelich is a frequent topic of conversation among Milwaukee's small, tight-knit Serbian community that likes cheering for athletes who have a connection to home, said Steve Petrovic, the president of the American Serb Hall on the city's southwest side. Petrovic said it's the same adulation Serbians feel for athletes like tennis superstar Novak Djokovic and retired NBA player Vlade Divac.\\n\\n\\\"When you're within the Serbian community, that kind of stuff is talked about -- 'Did you see Yelich had three hits the other night?'\\\" Petrovic said. \\\"That is very commonplace.\\\"\\n\\nSerbians' migration to Milwaukee began in the late 1800s, driven by poverty and overpopulation in Eastern Europe, said John Gurda, a Milwaukee historian and author.\\n\\nThey settled in Milwaukee's Walker's Point neighborhood, near the city's south side, and largely worked industrial jobs, Gurda said. Another wave of Serbian immigrants began arriving in Milwaukee in the 1980s during the wars in Sarajevo and the Bosnian conflict.\\n\\nThe St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral, the St. Sava Orthodox School and Serb Hall have become important gathering places for Serbians, who number about 4,000 in the area, according to census data.\\n\\n\\\"I can guarantee you that if you go out to Serb Hall or the school, they know (about Yelich) and they're proud,\\\" Gurda said.\\n\\nThat pride is part of Serbians' nationalistic streak and their \\\"special draw\\\" toward cheering on their own when they succeed, said Mike Uzelac, 63, former president of Serb Hall.\\n\\n\\\"We try to support each other, and root for each other whether it's basketball, football, acting, whatever,\\\" he said.\\n\\nNow that more Serbians are learning about Yelich's heritage, they want to make sure that others know it, too.\\n\\n\\\"Now I'm going to be bringing it up to all my friends,\\\" said Ilija Stojsavljevic, 47, an engineer from the Milwaukee suburb of Cudahy. \\\"I will be bringing that up whenever possible.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Milwaukee\"","lat":43,"lng":-87,"__v":0}

Carlos Bacca equalized in the 56th minute and as the game became more stretched Colombia took advantage on goals from Radamel Falcao in the 74th minute and substitute Miguel Borja five minutes later.\\n\\nIt proved a difficult night overall, especially on the defensive side of the ball.\\n\\n\\\"You can scout teams, you can watch teams, you can talk about moments that might come in the game, but now you're stepping on the field [against Colombia] and having to make decisions, and to do things quickly,\\\" said Sarachan.\\n\\n\\\"And so speed of play, technical speed, the moments they play a ball and take off, all of these moments for young players I hope add up in terms of their experience, and that's so important for these guys. That's why you play these games.\\\"\\n\\nThe night was especially difficult for the left side of the U.S. defense, with left-back Antonee Robinson and left-midfielder Kenny Saief struggling to stop a Colombia team intent on attacking that side. Saief eventually switched wings with Tim Weah, but that didn't stop Colombia from targeting that side.\\n\\n\\\"We did not do good job in terms of passing guys along and staying in what I would say is a better zone position,\\\" said Sarachan. \\\"So Antonee got pulled in at times, which allowed the right back [Santiago] Arias to get forward.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't think the coordination was very good, they had a pretty easy time of switching play to get it to that side, so we obviously we would have liked a little more pressure on the ball. We addressed it in the second half, still spotty at times, and they took advantage of that.\\\"\\n\\nBut Sarachan stressed that the defensive difficulties were team-wide.\\n\\n\\\"[In] moments we could have made better decisions,\\\" he said. \\\"Whether it was Bacca or Falcao when they withdrew [into midfield] we could have stepped and been a bit tighter on players, I think even just simple plays of winning tackles could have been better on the defensive side in terms of our backs.\\n\\n\\\"Obviously the vulnerability we showed at times when the ball was swung from one side to the other, the movement and the sliding was a little bit off at times. At the same time it's not an easy night when they're cutting through you like that. It was a hot night, they put in a workload.\\\"\\n\\nThe match marked Michael Bradley's first match with the U.S. in over a year. While Bradley was clean on the ball, he along with the rest of the midfield had difficulty keeping up with Colombia's attack. That said, Sarachan said he was pleased with Bradley's contribution.\\n\\n\\\"Michael is still a guy that has played in big games,\\\" said Sarachan. \\\"Nothing phases him, he's still a presence and an organizer. On the whole, he had a very solid night.\\n\\n\\\"He's trying to carry himself and do his job along with making sure he's helping the guys alongside him. He does what he always does, tries to make sure as a collective in terms of our shape and everything. He's the catalyst to make sure that goes pretty well. When they start throwing numbers, it's not just on Michael, he needed some help, left and right, but a solid night.\\\"\\n\\nSarachan also gave full credit to a veteran Colombia team for showing off the effectiveness of its attack.\\n\\n\\\"You saw the quality and when you allow them time and space, they can punish you,\\\" he said. \\\"Some pretty clever, pretty good goals tonight. Some were the benefit of some mistakes on our end, and some were great individual efforts.\\n\\n\\\"Let's keep in mind one thing tonight -- and I said this after the Brazil game -- we were playing against a team that's been together a long time and they've come from a World Cup. There weren't a lot of young faces and they know each other's movements pretty well.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Tampa, Florida\"","lat":27,"lng":-82,"__v":0}

But, seated across from President Donald Trump at the Resolute Desk, the musician delivered a rambling, multipart monologue Thursday that touched on social issues, hydrogen planes, mental health, endorsement deals, politics and oh so much more.\\n\\nSeizing the spotlight from the typically center-stage president, West dropped the F-word, floated policy proposals -- and went in for a hug.\\n\\n\\\"They tried to scare me to not wear this hat,\\\" West said of his red \\\"Make America Great Again\\\" cap. But, he said, \\\"This hat, it gives me power in a way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You made a Superman cape for me,\\\" he told Trump.\\n\\nIt was a surreal scene even by the standards of a nonconventional White House. The unlikely allies spoke to reporters before a closed-door lunch that had been billed as a forum to discuss policy issues including manufacturing, gangs, prison reform and violence in Chicago, where West grew up. Spectators at the show included Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, former NFL star Jim Brown, the attorney for a gang leader serving time in federal prison, and a gaggle of reporters.\\n\\nDuring one pause, Trump seemed to acknowledge the oddness of the moment, saying, \\\"That was quite something.\\\"\\n\\nWest's mental health has been a question of speculation since he was hospitalized in 2016. In a bizarre performance last month on \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" he delivered an unscripted pro-Trump message after the credits rolled.\\n\\nAddressing the topic Thursday, West said he had at one point been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but was later told by a neuropsychologist he'd been misdiagnosed.\\n\\n\\\"So he said that I actually wasn't bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe conversation began with an exchange on North Korea among Trump, Brown and West. Trump said the region was headed for war before he took over, and West commended him for stopping it. Brown said he liked North Korea; Trump agreed.\\n\\nFrom there, West discussed prison reform and violence in inner-city Chicago. He brought up Larry Hoover, the leader of the Gangster Disciples who is serving a life sentence for murder, claiming: \\\"The reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around.\\\"\\n\\nWest said he \\\"loved Hillary\\\" Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic rival, because he loves everyone, but said he connected with Trump's \\\"male energy.\\\" He also criticized the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, calling it a \\\"trap door.\\\"\\n\\nHolding out his phone, West showed Trump a picture of a hydrogen-powered plane that he thought should replace Air Force One.\\n\\n\\\"This right here is the iPlane 1,\\\" he said. \\\"This is what our president should be flying.\\\"\\n\\nAdded West: \\\"If he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our president. He has to be the freshest, the flyest\\\" and have \\\"the flyest planes.\\\"\\n\\nWest also had a sartorial suggestion for Trump, proposing a hat that says just \\\"Make America Great\\\" -- dropping the \\\"again.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of West's lengthy, sometimes-hard-to-follow dialogue, even Trump seemed at a loss.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you what: That was pretty impressive,\\\" the president said.\\n\\n\\\"It was from the soul,\\\" West replied. \\\"I just channeled it.\\\"\\n\\nWest later told reporters of his verbal stylings: \\\"You are tasting a fine wine that has multiple notes to it. You better play 4D chess with me. ... It's complex.\\\"\\n\\nTaking questions from reporters, the rapper also voiced concern about stop-and-frisk policing. Trump this week called on Chicago to embrace the tactic, which allowed police to detain, question and search civilians without probable cause, though it was deemed unconstitutional in New York City because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents.\\n\\nTrump said they'd discuss the matter and he'd keep an open mind.\\n\\nAsked about his comments in 2005 that President George W. Bush didn't \\\"care about black people\\\" after Hurricane Katrina, West said that \\\"We need to care about all people\\\" and that he \\\"was programed to think in a victimized mentality.\\\"\\n\\nTrump and West previously appeared together shortly after Trump's 2016 election in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York.\\n\\nAsked what the two had talked about during their December meeting, West responded briefly that time: \\\"Life. We discussed life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Trump has been shunned by much of the Hollywood establishment, he has a fan in West, who tweeted earlier this year that the two share \\\"dragon energy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother,\\\" West wrote.\\n\\nWest is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, who successfully pushed Trump to grant a pardon to a drug offender earlier this year.\\n\\nWest himself has suggested he might be open to wading into politics, including a run for president in 2020.\\n\\nAsked if West could be a future presidential candidate, Trump said, \\\"Could very well be.\\\" West shot back, \\\"Only after 2024.\\\"\\n\\nAfter all that, the president brought the show to a close by suggesting, \\\"Let's go have some lunch, OK?\\\"\\n\\n___\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

Instead of being a bit piece, though, Gonzalez played a vital role for Milwaukee, posting a 2.13 ERA in five starts, including five-shutout innings in the regular-season finale that sent the Brewers to a Game 163 showdown with the Cubs for the NL Central title.\\n\\n\\\"It's a pretty cool story,\\\" Gonzalez admitted Thursday as the Brewers and Dodgers worked out at Miller Park ahead of the series opener. \\\"They wanted me to be a part of this.\\\"\\n\\nGonzalez likely won't be out there long. The Brewers have kept their starters' outings short all season, choosing to rely on one of the game's best bullpens and it's been no different in the postseason as no Milwaukee starter has worked more than five innings, including a three-inning stint by Brandon Woodruff as part of a \\\"bullpen day\\\" in Game 1 of the NLDS against Colorado.\\n\\nGonzalez was on the roster for that series but didn't see action. Some expected Milwaukee to turn to right-hander Jhoulys Chacin for Game 1, but he'll get the nod in Game 3 instead.\\n\\n\\\"We just like the matchup,\\\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said of Gonzalez. \\\"We like the matchup against their lineup. It's no secret that we're going to use our pitching a little different than the traditionalists might like and so for us, the first matchup we liked was Gio on the mound.\\\"\\n\\nAfter avoiding a decisive fifth game against Atlanta, the Dodgers send ace left-hander Clayton Kershaw to the mound for the opener. In 14 career starts against the Brewers, Kershaw is 6-5 with a 2.86 ERA, including a 4-1 record and 1.40 mark in seven career starts at Miller Park.\\n\\nHe split his two starts against Milwaukee this season, allowing four runs (one earned) over six innings in a 4-2 loss at Miller Park on July 21 then striking out seven while allowing just two runs over six innings in a 21-5 rout at Dodger Stadium on Aug. 2.\\n\\nThe Brewers batted .250 (12-for-48) against Kershaw this season, numbers that were inflated by Christian Yelich, who went 4-for-6 with a pair of home runs against Kershaw in 2018 and is 9-for-17 (.529) against him for his career.\\n\\n\\\"He's a really good hitter,\\\" Kershaw said. \\\"He's definitely got some hits off me for sure, so I have to try to not let him do that (Friday).\\\"\\n\\nYelich is one of the few \\\"for sure\\\" players in Craig Counsell's lineup, along with fellow outfielders Ryan Braun and Lorenzo Cain as well as first baseman Jesus Aguilar. Beyond that, Counsell has mixed and matched the rest of his lineup depending on matchups all season long and doesn't expect that to change during the NLCS, especially with the Dodgers' lefty-heavy rotation.\\n\\nThat means Hernan Perez, Orlando Arcia and Jonathan Schoop could see significantly more playing time than they did in the NLCS, with Travis Shaw and Mike Moustakas possibly seeing a little less action than they have the last few weeks.\\n\\n\\\"We'll have some different lineups in this series,\\\" Counsell said. \\\"With three pretty solid left-handed starters, it's a good chance for our right-handed hitters to do some damage.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Milwaukee\"","lat":43,"lng":-87,"__v":0}

The ball rolled forward through the end zone after defender Trevon Moehrig-Woodard knocked it loose right at the goal line.\\n\\n\\\"They caught us in a blitz,\\\" TCU coach Gary Patterson said. \\\"You've got to give coach (Kliff) Kingsbury a lot of credit.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the third time the Red Raiders (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) won in their last four trips to Fort Worth. They needed multiple overtimes in each of the previous two wins.\\n\\nThe final drive for TCU (3-3, 1-2) ended when Shawn Robinson desperately scrambled from one side of the field to the other on fourth-and-1 before the ball appeared to slip out of his hands and was intercepted by Adrian Frye in the final minute.\\n\\nDuffey finished 13-of-24 passing for 190 yards, including a 62-yard touchdown in the third quarter to Ja'Deion High, who was wide open at the 30 and ran the rest of the way. Duffey also had 16 carries for 83 yards.\\n\\n\\\"I was really proud of Jett, that's such a hard situation, first start ever and at halftime we're going to try something else,\\\" Kingsbury said. \\\"Then have to put him back in, and find a way, dig deep, be mentally tough enough to handle that, make enough plays to win the game. I can't say enough about his mental toughness.\\\"\\n\\nDuffey was the third quarterback to play for Texas Tech this season.

Joe Donnelly is hoping another Democrat with blue-collar appeal and presidential ambitions -- Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden -- can deliver a similarly authentic message Friday during a campaign swing through the industrial, middle-class region.\\n\\nFor Donnelly, victory in a neck-and-neck race with Republican businessman Mike Braun requires a big turnout in the Democratic stronghold of northwest Indiana, which draws more from the machine politics of nearby Chicago than the rural conservatism prevalent elsewhere in the state.\\n\\n\\\"Northwest Indiana is red meat for Joe Donnelly,\\\" said Hammond Mayor Tom McDermott, who was with Clinton during the Crown Royal moment in 2008. \\\"Eight out of 10 of those people that show up are going to vote for Joe Donnelly.\\\"\\n\\nBut Biden won't be the only vice president paying a visit to the state. Three hours south, Vice President Mike Pence -- the state's former governor -- will rally GOP activists at a fundraising dinner with Braun and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in Indianapolis.\\n\\nThe dueling appearances by the vice president and his predecessor underscore high stakes in this battleground race that could help determine control of the Senate.\\n\\nDonnelly has held a slight edge in recent polls, but the race remains within the margin of error. Still to be seen is whether Donnelly's vote against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh could impact the race. Republicans have fanned GOP outrage over the tactics used by Democrats in their attempt to block his nomination, which has upended other races in other states that President Donald Trump carried.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that both of them are in the state on the same day is evidence that it's a 1-, 2-, or 3-point race with enough undecided voters that turnout is going to matter,\\\" said Mike O'Brien, a veteran Republican operative who ran Gov. Eric Holcomb's successful 2016 campaign. Pence's visit is important, he added, because \\\"there's a thousand people in that room that we need working their hardest in the final 30 days.\\\"\\n\\nDonnelly, Indiana's lone statewide Democrat, won his first Senate election in 2012 by running up big numbers in northwest Indiana and the Indianapolis area, heavily populated places where he needs to do well again to keep his seat.\\n\\nHe won almost 70 percent of the vote in Lake County, where Friday's rally will be held -- his best showing in any county. It's a place where precinct committee members can be a powerful force for turnout.\\n\\n\\\"In politics you always have to pay your respects, you never want to take anyone for granted and this is just a smart way to chessboard out a victory,\\\" said Christina Hale, a northern Indiana native who was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2016.\\n\\nThroughout the campaign, Donnelly has appeared in ads where he crisscrosses the state in a used RV while touting his willingness to buck liberal Democrats in Congress and \\\"drive down the Hoosier common-sense middle.\\\"\\n\\nBut Republicans are trying to challenge this down-home image. They say he talks a good game but is ultimately a tool of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.\\n\\nThat's where Biden could help.\\n\\nHis visit is generating excitement, in part because he could run for president in 2020, McDermott said. But Biden, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, has also criticized Democrats for turning their back on middle America. A visit would not only boost Donnelly but demonstrate Biden's willing to campaign in places Clinton largely overlooked in 2016.\\n\\nMcDermott said Biden will be much more of a draw for Donnelly than Pence will be for Braun. He described Pence as an unpopular governor who \\\"got lucky\\\" when Trump tapped him to be his running mate.\\n\\n\\\"He left because he knew he was going to lose,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm not intimidated by Mike Pence.\\\"\\n\\nBut others are wondering if Donnelly, who has brought in few national figures to campaign for him, may be in trouble. Recently, his campaign started buying airtime in the expensive Chicago TV market, Federal Communications Commission filings show.\\n\\n\\\"It makes me wonder what's up,\\\" said Cam Savage, a Republican consultant who helped Sen. Todd Young win in 2016. \\\"They must be underperforming up there and my guess is they are concerned.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Indianapolis\"","lat":39,"lng":-86,"__v":0}

But, seated across from President Donald Trump at the Resolute Desk, the musician delivered a rambling, multipart monologue Thursday that touched on social issues, hydrogen planes, mental health, endorsement deals, politics and oh so much more.\\n\\nSeizing the spotlight from the typically center-stage president, West dropped the F-word, floated policy proposals -- and went in for a hug.\\n\\n\\\"They tried to scare me to not wear this hat,\\\" West said of his red \\\"Make America Great Again\\\" cap. But, he said, \\\"This hat, it gives me power in a way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You made a Superman cape for me,\\\" he told Trump.\\n\\nIt was a surreal scene even by the standards of a nonconventional White House. The unlikely allies spoke to reporters before a closed-door lunch that had been billed as a forum to discuss policy issues including manufacturing, gangs, prison reform and violence in Chicago, where West grew up. Spectators at the show included Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, former NFL star Jim Brown, the attorney for a gang leader serving time in federal prison, and a gaggle of reporters.\\n\\nDuring one pause, Trump seemed to acknowledge the oddness of the moment, saying, \\\"That was quite something.\\\"\\n\\nWest's mental health has been a question of speculation since he was hospitalized in 2016. In a bizarre performance last month on \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" he delivered an unscripted pro-Trump message after the credits rolled.\\n\\nAddressing the topic Thursday, West said he had at one point been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but was later told by a neuropsychologist he'd been misdiagnosed.\\n\\n\\\"So he said that I actually wasn't bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe conversation began with an exchange on North Korea among Trump, Brown and West. Trump said the region was headed for war before he took over, and West commended him for stopping it. Brown said he liked North Korea; Trump agreed.\\n\\nFrom there, West discussed prison reform and violence in inner-city Chicago. He brought up Larry Hoover, the leader of the Gangster Disciples who is serving a life sentence for murder, claiming: \\\"The reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around.\\\"\\n\\nWest said he \\\"loved Hillary\\\" Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic rival, because he loves everyone, but said he connected with Trump's \\\"male energy.\\\" He also criticized the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, calling it a \\\"trap door.\\\"\\n\\nHolding out his phone, West showed Trump a picture of a hydrogen-powered plane that he thought should replace Air Force One.\\n\\n\\\"This right here is the iPlane 1,\\\" he said. \\\"This is what our president should be flying.\\\"\\n\\nAdded West: \\\"If he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our president. He has to be the freshest, the flyest\\\" and have \\\"the flyest planes.\\\"\\n\\nWest also had a sartorial suggestion for Trump, proposing a hat that says just \\\"Make America Great\\\" -- dropping the \\\"again.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of West's lengthy, sometimes-hard-to-follow dialogue, even Trump seemed at a loss.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you what: That was pretty impressive,\\\" the president said.\\n\\n\\\"It was from the soul,\\\" West replied. \\\"I just channeled it.\\\"\\n\\nWest later told reporters of his verbal stylings: \\\"You are tasting a fine wine that has multiple notes to it. You better play 4D chess with me. ... It's complex.\\\"\\n\\nTaking questions from reporters, the rapper also voiced concern about stop-and-frisk policing. Trump this week called on Chicago to embrace the tactic, which allowed police to detain, question and search civilians without probable cause, though it was deemed unconstitutional in New York City because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents.\\n\\nTrump said they'd discuss the matter and he'd keep an open mind.\\n\\nAsked about his comments in 2005 that President George W. Bush didn't \\\"care about black people\\\" after Hurricane Katrina, West said that \\\"We need to care about all people\\\" and that he \\\"was programed to think in a victimized mentality.\\\"\\n\\nTrump and West previously appeared together shortly after Trump's 2016 election in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York.\\n\\nAsked what the two had talked about during their December meeting, West responded briefly that time: \\\"Life. We discussed life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Trump has been shunned by much of the Hollywood establishment, he has a fan in West, who tweeted earlier this year that the two share \\\"dragon energy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother,\\\" West wrote.\\n\\nWest is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, who successfully pushed Trump to grant a pardon to a drug offender earlier this year.\\n\\nWest himself has suggested he might be open to wading into politics, including a run for president in 2020.\\n\\nAsked if West could be a future presidential candidate, Trump said, \\\"Could very well be.\\\" West shot back, \\\"Only after 2024.\\\"\\n\\nAfter all that, the president brought the show to a close by suggesting, \\\"Let's go have some lunch, OK?\\\"\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

He has four doubles, no homers, six walks and nine strikeouts.\\n\\nAgainst the Yankees in the four-game ALDS that wrapped Tuesday, Betts went 3-for-16 with one double, four Ks and three free passes.\\n\\n\\\"Game 3 was outstanding, Game 4 I think he got caught up in trying to do a lot, which is understandable.\\\" manager Alex Cora said Thursday at Fenway Park. \\\"It's good that we won and he didn't take charge offensively like he's been doing the whole season, so that's a plus for our team. And I know he's prepared. He's in here in the scouting report, and how bad he was last year against Houston from his manager.\\n\\n\\\"He'll be ready. He had a great series against them here [when the Astros visited Boston in September]. He only chased one bad pitch out of the zone against [Josh] James on a 3-2 slider.

I mentioned it to him. He was like, 'Well, yeah, I was doing that.'

The index dropped a further 2.06 percent on Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"Are they really going to launch into this window?\\\" asked one source involved in the deal, adding that the company had plenty of cash. \\\"Why try and jam something out now?\\\"\\n\\nChinese shares have also fallen, with the CSI 300 index of mainland Chinese blue-chips \u003c.CSI300\u003e down 4.8 percent to a 27-month low on Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"Given the recent challenging market conditions, it won't be a good idea for the company to go ahead with the listing timetable. It makes more sense to wait till the market recovers a bit,\\\" said another person with knowledge of the matter.\\n\\nTencent Music declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as the information was not public.\\n\\nAt $2 billion, the IPO would be one of the largest by a Chinese company in the United States this year, behind the $2.4 billion raised by video streaming company iQiyi \u003cIQ.O\u003e in March but ahead of the $1.6 billion garnered by online group discounter Pinduoduo \u003cPDD.O\u003e in July.\\n\\nIn total, Chinese companies have raised $7.5 billion from U.S. markets so far this year - the biggest amount since 2014 - according to Refinitiv data.\\n\\nTencent Music filed for its IPO earlier this month, setting a placeholder sum of $1 billion for registration purposes.\\n\\nThe company owns streaming apps QQ Music, Kugou and Kuwo as well as karaoke app WeSing, and claims more than 800 million monthly active users.\\n\\nThe number of Tencent Music shares to be sold were not disclosed and potential valuations were unclear. Its Swedish music streaming counterpart Spotify Technology SA \u003cSPOT.N\u003e is currently valued at around $27.1 billion.\\n\\nThe Chinese firm, which has a cross shareholding deal with Spotify, offers more in the way of socially interactive services that makes it profitable, while the Swedish firm is not.

But, seated across from President Donald Trump at the Resolute Desk, the musician delivered a rambling, multipart monologue Thursday that touched on social issues, hydrogen planes, mental health, endorsement deals, politics and oh so much more.\\n\\nSeizing the spotlight from the typically center-stage president, West dropped the F-word, floated policy proposals -- and went in for a hug.\\n\\n\\\"They tried to scare me to not wear this hat,\\\" West said of his red \\\"Make America Great Again\\\" cap. But, he said, \\\"This hat, it gives me power in a way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You made a Superman cape for me,\\\" he told Trump.\\n\\nIt was a surreal scene even by the standards of a nonconventional White House. The unlikely allies spoke to reporters before a closed-door lunch that had been billed as a forum to discuss policy issues including manufacturing, gangs, prison reform and violence in Chicago, where West grew up. Spectators at the show included Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, former NFL star Jim Brown, the attorney for a gang leader serving time in federal prison, and a gaggle of reporters.\\n\\nDuring one pause, Trump seemed to acknowledge the oddness of the moment, saying, \\\"That was quite something.\\\"\\n\\nWest's mental health has been a question of speculation since he was hospitalized in 2016. In a bizarre performance last month on \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" he delivered an unscripted pro-Trump message after the credits rolled.\\n\\nAddressing the topic Thursday, West said he had at one point been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but was later told by a neuropsychologist he'd been misdiagnosed.\\n\\n\\\"So he said that I actually wasn't bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe conversation began with an exchange on North Korea among Trump, Brown and West. Trump said the region was headed for war before he took over, and West commended him for stopping it. Brown said he liked North Korea; Trump agreed.\\n\\nFrom there, West discussed prison reform and violence in inner-city Chicago. He brought up Larry Hoover, the leader of the Gangster Disciples who is serving a life sentence for murder, claiming: \\\"The reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community.

I want to get back to the house.\\\"\\n\\nThe Jazz had the unusual circumstance of playing the same team in the same place for their final preseason game as for their season opener, which will be Wednesday night at the Golden 1 Center.\\n\\nBoth coaches said it was unusual to be playing the same team just a few days apart.\\n\\nKings coach Dave Joerger said because the Jazz were more experienced \\\"they could hold back more of their stuff.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, of his own team, he said, \\\"We've got pretty remedial, basic stuff we need to get better at so tonight is the same as (next week).

When their house filled with surging ocean water, they fled upstairs. Now their home is full of mud and everywhere they look there's utter devastation in their Florida Panhandle community: fishing boats tossed like toys, roofs lifted off of buildings and pine trees snapped like matchsticks in 155 mph winds.\\n\\nRow after row of beachfront homes were so obliterated by Michael's surging seas and howling winds that only slabs of concrete in the sand remain, a testament that this was ground zero when the epic Category 4 hurricane slammed ashore at midweek. The destruction in this and other communities dotting the white-sand beaches is being called catastrophic -- and it will need billions of dollars to rebuild.\\n\\n\\\"All of my furniture was floating,\\\" said Marquardt, 67. \\\"'A river just started coming down the road. It was awful, and now there's just nothing left.\\\"\\n\\nAt least three deaths were blamed on Michael, the most powerful hurricane to hit the continental U.S. in over 50 years, and by early Friday it wasn't over yet: a tropical storm long after Wednesday's landfall, Michael stubbornly kept up its punch while barreling up the Southeast, dumping heavy rains and spreading flash flooding misery as far away as Virginia.\\n\\nHigh winds, downed trees, streets inundated by rising waters and multiple rescues of motorists from waterlogged cars played out in spots around Virginia and neighboring North Carolina. And while forecasters said Michael was gradually losing its tropical traits, it was a new chapter would begin as an extratropical storm predicted to intensify with gale force winds once it starts cross out into the Atlantic.\\n\\nIn North Carolina's mountains, motorists had to be rescued Thursday from cars trapped by high water. High winds toppled trees and power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands without power.\\n\\nFlash flooding also was reported in the big North Carolina cities of Charlotte and Raleigh. Similar scenes played out in parts of Virginia as the storm raced seaward.\\n\\nAll told, more than 900,000 homes and businesses in Florida, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas were without power.\\n\\nMeanwhile, thousands of National Guard troops, law enforcement officers and rescue teams still had much to do in the hardest hit area: Florida's Panhandle. Families living along the Panhandle are now faced with a struggle to survive in a perilous landscape of shattered homes and shopping centers, the storm debris spread far and wide.\\n\\nIn one community, Panama City, most homes were still standing, but no property was left undamaged. Downed power lines and twisted street signs lay all around. Aluminum siding was shredded and homes were split by fallen trees. Hundreds of cars had broken windows. The hurricane damaged hospitals and nursing homes in Panama City, and officials worked to evacuate hundreds of patients.\\n\\n\\\"So many lives have been changed forever. So many families have lost everything,\\\" said Florida Gov. Rick Scott, calling it \\\"unimaginable destruction.\\\"\\n\\nAn insurance company that produces models for catastrophes estimated Michael caused about $8 billion in damage. Boston-based Karen Clark \u0026 Company released that estimate Thursday, which includes privately insured wind and storm surge damage to residential, commercial and industrial properties and vehicles. It doesn't include losses covered by the National Flood Insurance Program.\\n\\nAnd Michael also was deadly, both in Florida and beyond.\\n\\nA man outside Tallahassee, Florida, was killed by a falling tree, and an 11-year-old girl in Georgia died when Michael's winds picked up a carport and dropped it on her home, debris striking her in the head.\\n\\nA driver in North Carolina also was killed when a tree fell on his car.\\n\\nSome fear the toll can only rise as rescue teams get around storm debris blocking roads and reach isolated areas.\\n\\nMore than 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast were ordered or urged to clear out as Michael closed in. But emergency authorities lamented that many ignored the warnings.\\n\\nThe Coast Guard said it rescued at least 27 people before and after the hurricane's landfall, mostly from coastal homes. Nine people had to be rescued by helicopter from a bathroom of a home in hard-hit Panama City after their roof collapsed, Petty Officer 3rd Class Ronald Hodges said.\\n\\nIn hard-hit Mexico Beach alone, state officials say, 285 people in Mexico Beach defied a mandatory evacuation order ahead of Michael. The task ahead: finding and hopefully safely accounting for all those who stayed behind.\\n\\nNational Guard troops made their way into the ground-zero town and found 20 survivors initially Wednesday night, and more rescue crews are arriving. But the fate of many residents was unknown.\\n\\nMishelle McPherson and her ex-husband searched for the elderly mother of a friend. The woman lived in a small cinderblock house about 150 yards (meters) from the Gulf and thought she would be OK. The home was found smashed, with no sign of the woman.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think her body would be here? Do you think it would have floated away?\\\" McPherson asked.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Panama City\"","lat":8,"lng":-79,"__v":0}

The message to Republican voters: Democrats are employing radical tactics that are only growing worse.\\n\\n\\\"Only one side was happy to play host to this toxic fringe behavior,\\\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday in the latest GOP attack. \\\"Only one side's leaders are now openly calling for more of it. They haven't seen enough. They want more. And I'm afraid this is only Phase One of the meltdown.\\\"\\n\\nWhile the demonstrations were intense and some Republicans reported personal threats, liberal protesters' tactics were broadly in line with those used by groups on the left and right during particularly passionate moments in Washington. The confrontational style harkened back to protests by the conservative tea party, which included angry face-offs with lawmakers and a massive Capitol demonstration far larger than last week's rallies.\\n\\nIt's not unusual for Republicans and Democrats alike to sharpen their rhetoric as elections approach in hopes of drawing loyal voters to the polls. But the GOP shift to disparaging descriptions of their opponents as unruly and sinister is a marked change from their messaging before the Kavanaugh battle, when they'd hoped to focus on the strong economy and the mammoth tax cut they pushed through Congress last December.\\n\\nBoth parties have detected a surge in engagement among GOP and conservative voters since the nation's attention was grabbed by the confirmation battle over Kavanaugh, including allegations of sexual misconduct that he denied. While no one knows if that energy will last until Election Day, Democratic voters driven by an animus toward Trump until now were far more motivated.\\n\\nTop Republicans have acknowledged that television scenes of anti-Kavanaugh protesters berating senators and interrupting Senate debate have helped them.\\n\\n\\\"It's turned our base on fire,\\\" McConnell said about the battle, which he's called a political gift. Focusing on the \\\"mob\\\" has also let Republicans raise the subject without explicitly reminding voters about Kavanaugh himself, who polling showed was viewed unfavorably by the public.\\n\\nSo far, Republicans have shown no signs of abandoning that focus.\\n\\n\\\"The Democrats are willing to do anything, to hurt anyone, to get the power they so desperately crave,\\\" Trump said at a rally in Minnesota last week. He added, \\\"They want to destroy.\\\"\\n\\nDemocrats argue that the party of Trump and the conservative tea party has nerve to decry such behavior.\\n\\n\\\"The last time I looked, the mocker-in-chief is in the White House,\\\" said Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. Trump drew fresh ire last week when he ridiculed Christine Blasey Ford, the first of Kavanaugh's three women accusers.\\n\\nDemocrats say Trump's rhetoric since launching his 2016 campaign has been provocative, pugnacious and at times racist. They cite numerous comments about Mexicans, Muslims, African countries. They also noted his statement that there were \\\"very fine people on both sides\\\" after an anti-Nazi demonstrator was killed by a white supremacist at a violent 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\\n\\nNo. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois said Thursday that his response to GOP accusations of Democratic mob tactics \\\"is to say three words: 'Lock her up.'\\\"\\n\\nCrowds at Trump campaign rallies have long chanted that about 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. They've aimed it in recent days at Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who some Republicans have accused of leaking Ford's letter claiming sexual assault by Kavanaugh. Feinstein has denied the leak.\\n\\nGrass roots tea party activists opposed to President Barack Obama's health care bill noisily disrupted lawmakers' town hall meetings across the country in summer 2009, booing and accusing Democrats of lying. One man in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, told a lawmaker that God will \\\"judge you and the rest of your damned cronies on the Hill,\\\" while a Boston woman demanded to know, \\\"Why do you continue to support a Nazi policy?\\\"\\n\\nThat September, tens of thousands of tea party demonstrators ringed the Capitol to protest the health care law and what they considered a wasteful, oversized federal government. That crowd, which dwarfed the hundreds or several thousand anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators, vented anger at times, shouting \\\"Liar, liar\\\" and waving sings including one saying, \\\"Bury Obama Care with Kennedy,\\\" a reference to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who had recently died.\\n\\nBlack lawmakers said they were targeted by racial epithets and spat upon during a smaller rally by several thousand tea party supporters in March 2010, as Congress was voting on the health care legislation.\\n\\nIn remarks Thursday, McConnell described last week's anti-Kavanaugh protesters as \\\"literally storming the steps of the Capitol and the Supreme Court,\\\" confronting Republicans at restaurants and airports and shouting from visitors' galleries during Senate debates. Republicans have said some received death threats and were stalked at their homes.\\n\\nMcConnell criticized Clinton, who said on CNN this week that \\\"civility can start again\\\" after Democrats capture the House or Senate in next month's elections.\\n\\nHe also criticized former Attorney General Eric Holder. In a video purportedly shot at a recent campaign event in Georgia, Holder says, \\\"When they go low, we kick them,\\\" paraphrasing former first lady Michelle Obama, who famously said during the 2016 campaign, \\\"When they go low, we go high.\\\"\\n\\nMcConnell noted that these activities followed last year's shooting of GOP lawmakers at a morning baseball practice by \\\"a politically crazed gunman.\\\"\\n\\nGunman James Hodgkinson, killed at the scene by officers, was infuriated by Trump's election. His social media posts suggest he targeted Republicans because of his political views.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP researcher Rhonda Shafner and reporters Steve Peoples and Kevin Freking contributed.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

But Biden, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, has also criticized Democrats for turning their back on middle America. A visit would not only boost Donnelly but demonstrate Biden's willing to campaign in places Clinton largely overlooked in 2016.\\n\\nMcDermott said Biden will be much more of a draw for Donnelly than Pence will be for Braun.

The Brewers are a +140 underdog, where a $100 bet would earn $140.\\n\\nWhile the players can't be involved in any of that kind of stuff, they can contemplate the whole premise about their team's perception heading into Game 1 of the NLCS on Friday night at Miller Park.\\n\\nInfielder Travis Shaw, for one, fully embraced the notion that the Brewers enter the series in an underdog role. He sees it as part of the DNA of a team representing Milwaukee against a team from Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\\"I think we're taking the underdog mentality,\\\" Shaw said before the team's workout on Wednesday. \\\"Look at the four teams that are left.

He faces one count of first-degree murder and one count of disinterment of the dead in connection with the death of his wife Carol Jean Pierce.\\n\\nHe is being held at Cheboygan County Jail pending his return to Wisconsin. It's unclear if Pierce has an attorney to speak on his behalf.\\n\\nCarol Jean Pierce was 35 when she disappeared from the couple's trailer home in Sturgeon Bay in September 1975. Her body has never been found.\\n\\nRichard Pierce previously claimed that she walked out on him. But cold case detectives with the Wisconsin Association of Homicide Investigators allege in a criminal complaint that Pierce had the opportunity and motivation to kill her.\\n\\nThe 20-page complaint offers mostly circumstantial evidence, recounting witness interviews collected over four decades that paint a picture of an abusive marriage.\\n\\nAccording to the complaint, the couple got married in September 1966. Pierce was a sailor in the U.S. Coast Guard at the time, assigned to the cutter Mesquite. The ship was based in Sturgeon Bay when Carol Jean disappeared.\\n\\nAcquaintances told detectives the couple argued often. A woman who lived next door to the couple when they were stationed in New Jersey told investigators that Carol Jean had told her Pierce had beat her the night before and her face was badly bruised.\\n\\nAnother neighbor reported that Carol Jean told her at least three times she thought Pierce was going to kill her and she wanted to go somewhere no one would find her.\\n\\nPierce's former shipmates told authorities that Carol Jean didn't trust Pierce and she had a personality that would probably \\\"drive a guy like Pierce nuts.\\\" One shipmate recalled how the ship captain's wife had died from a fall down stairs and how Pierce had commented \\\"that was a pretty good deal. (The captain) got rid of his wife.\\\"\\n\\nAfter Carol Jean disappeared, a neighbor visited the couple's trailer home to see how Pierce was doing. She noticed Carol Jean's purse on the kitchen counter and her entire record collection, as well as her cat and make-up, were still in the home.\\n\\nThe complaint said that Pierce told then-Sturgeon Bay Police Chief Michael Nordin in 1982 that Carol Jean had made off with $1,000 cash that Pierce had hidden in a standard-size envelope -- even though $1,000 wouldn't have fit in such an envelope, the chief wrote.\\n\\nPierce also claimed during that interview that he had used the Sturgeon Bay phone book to call Green Bay hospitals looking for Carol Jean. The phone book didn't list any Green Bay hospitals, the chief noted.\\n\\nThe cold case detectives conclude that Carol Jean's death meant a number of gains for Pierce, including a pension unencumbered by marriage, most of the couple's important belongings, sole possession of the couple's retirement land in Michigan and a new girlfriend.\\n\\nTagged: Jean, Cheboygan, Michigan, United States, North America, Wisconsin, Green Bay\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Madison, Wisconsin\"","lat":43,"lng":-89,"__v":0}

Joe Donnelly is hoping another Democrat with blue-collar appeal and presidential ambitions -- Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden -- can deliver a similarly authentic message Friday during a campaign swing through the industrial, middle-class region.\\n\\nFor Donnelly, victory in a neck-and-neck race with Republican businessman Mike Braun requires a big turnout in the Democratic stronghold of northwest Indiana, which draws more from the machine politics of nearby Chicago than the rural conservatism prevalent elsewhere in the state.\\n\\n\\\"Northwest Indiana is red meat for Joe Donnelly,\\\" said Hammond Mayor Tom McDermott, who was with Clinton during the Crown Royal moment in 2008. \\\"Eight out of 10 of those people that show up are going to vote for Joe Donnelly.\\\"\\n\\nBut Biden won't be the only vice president paying a visit to the state.

Still to be seen is whether Donnelly's vote against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh could impact the race. Republicans have fanned GOP outrage over the tactics used by Democrats in their attempt to block his nomination, which has upended other races in other states that President Donald Trump carried.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that both of them are in the state on the same day is evidence that it's a 1-, 2-, or 3-point race with enough undecided voters that turnout is going to matter,\\\" said Mike O'Brien, a veteran Republican operative who ran Gov.

The ball rolled forward through the end zone after defender Trevon Moehrig-Woodard knocked it loose right at the goal line.\\n\\n\\\"They caught us in a blitz,\\\" TCU coach Gary Patterson said. \\\"You've got to give coach (Kliff) Kingsbury a lot of credit.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the third time the Red Raiders (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) won in their last four trips to Fort Worth. They needed multiple overtimes in each of the previous two wins.\\n\\nThe final drive for TCU (3-3, 1-2) ended when Shawn Robinson desperately scrambled from one side of the field to the other on fourth-and-1 before the ball appeared to slip out of his hands and was intercepted by Adrian Frye in the final minute.\\n\\nDuffey finished 13-of-24 passing for 190 yards, including a 62-yard touchdown in the third quarter to Ja'Deion High, who was wide open at the 30 and ran the rest of the way. Duffey also had 16 carries for 83 yards.\\n\\n\\\"I was really proud of Jett, that's such a hard situation, first start ever and at halftime we're going to try something else,\\\" Kingsbury said. \\\"Then have to put him back in, and find a way, dig deep, be mentally tough enough to handle that, make enough plays to win the game. I can't say enough about his mental toughness.\\\"\\n\\nDuffey was the third quarterback to play for Texas Tech this season. McLane Carter suffered a high left ankle sprain in the first quarter after starting the opener and was replaced by true freshman Alan Bowman, who was the nation's leading passer before a crushing blow in the last game that left him with a partially collapsed lung.\\n\\nAll three quarterbacks took part in pregame warmups. Carter wasn't in full uniform when the game started and Carter played only the opening series of the second half. With his ankle affecting his mobility, he was sacked on consecutive plays.\\n\\nRobinson was 26-of-45 passing for 290 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.\\n\\nThe Frogs were up 14-10 when KaVontae Turpin streaked past a defender and into the end zone to make a 31-yard TD catch with 11 minutes left. Turpin had six catches for 120 yards.\\n\\nTHE TAKEAWAY\\n\\nTexas Tech: The Red Raiders were held to 353 total yards, well below their national-best average of 591 yards a game. They had also scored 48 points a game. But Duffey made enough plays, especially the two big touchdowns.\\n\\nTCU: The Horned Frogs had their eight-game home winning streak snapped. They had 411 total yards, but couldn't overcome mistakes. They had three turnovers, including an interception in the end zone, and had a missed field goal attempt.\\n\\nTCU plays its third consecutive home game Oct. 20 against No. 11 Oklahoma.\\n\\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Fort Worth, Texas\"","lat":32,"lng":-97,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc0301915ee281f201b4c67"},"title":"\"Sleep well, Eagles fans. This is still the only good team in the NFC East | David Murphy\"","body":"\"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Nobody else in the NFC East has what the Eagles have. Nobody else can even approximate it. We did not need to see what we saw on Thursday night to know any of this. But it was a reminder, and a strong one at that.\\n\\nIn a 34-13 decimation of a Giants team that was its usual hapless, apathetic, dysfunctional self, the Eagles' offense turned in the kind of performance that should tamp down the neurotic hand-wringing that has consumed a significant chunk of the fan base and media over the past couple of weeks.\\n\\n\\\"Today felt like last year,\\\" running back Corey Clement said. \\\"I think that's what we need to keep stacking, realizing what we can do and who we really are.\\\"\\n\\nYou saw everything you hoped to see, everything you needed to see. There was Alshon Jeffery catching eight passes for 74 yards and two touchdowns, with Carson Wentz targeting him 12 times. The connection between Jeffery and Wentz is one of those bedrocks that can stabilize an offense in tumultuous times. Three of Wentz's first six passes went to the big wide receiver, one of them for a touchdown, the other for a 17-yard first down on a touchdown drive that gave the Eagles a 14-3 lead with 1:28 remaining in the first quarter.\\n\\nIn the backfield, Clement looked strong and smooth, getting to the edge and turning the corner on a 14-yard run late in the first quarter that helped set up his own 1-yard touchdown run. Early in the third quarter, he made a nice cut after catching a screen pass and scampered down the field for a 20-yard gain. Clement and Wendell Smallwood combined for 94 yards on 29 carries and another 26 yards on four catches. Those numbers are hardly overwhelming, but it is debatable how much blame belongs on the backfield and how much on an offensive line that suddenly looks nothing like the unit that paved the way for last year's Super Bowl.\\n\\nOf all the reasons folks have worried about this Eagles team over the past couple of weeks, the blockers are one of the legitimate few. Lane Johnson was already reportedly dealing with a high ankle sprain. Against the Giants, Jason Peters went down with a biceps injury. There are significant concerns here.\\n\\nBut the Eagles also have an entire season to figure these things out, because there is nobody else in the division who is poised to take advantage of the early season hiccups.\\n\\nThese are not good times for the NFC East. Heading into the night, the division's four teams each ranked among the NFL's 10 lowest-scoring teams. They all ranked in the bottom half in yards per play, passing yards per game, and point differential. By the end of Thursday night, one of those teams had begun a course correction. And it is tough to envision any of the remaining three making up ground.\\n\\nAt this point, the closest approximation to a challenge appears to be the Redskins, who are coming off a 43-19 shellacking in New Orleans that somehow wasn't as close as the scoreboard made it appear. At 2-2, they are technically tied with the 3-3 Eagles for the division lead, their two victories coming over Arizona and Green Bay. But Washington is a team that has virtually no significant weapons on offense. Alex Smith might be enough to get you to the playoffs when he is managing an offense that features Tyreek Hill, Jason Kelce and Kareem Hunt. But Jamison Crowder and Paul Richardson are another story.\\n\\nThe Cowboys will at least bring a competitive defense to the field each week, but they've failed to reach 300 yards of total offense in three of their five games, most recently in a 19-16 overtime loss to a Texans team that hardly looks like a serious contender.\\n\\n\u003e\u003e PHOTO GALLERY: Scenes from the Eagles-Giants game\\n\\nAnd then we have the Giants.\\n\\nIf they weren't an embarrassment before, they most definitely are now. Their blockers can't block. Their quarterback can't throw. The body language on the sideline and in the huddle was astonishing to witness out of a veteran team this early in the season. There was Eli Manning gesturing wildly in frustration at backup running back Wayne Gallman after a missed connection in the first quarter. There was head coach Pat Shurmur caught by television cameras muttering exasperatedly after watching another one of Manning's check-down throws. There was Odell Beckham, less than a week after questioning his team's heart in a national television interview, departing the sideline for the locker room with 2 seconds still remaining on the second-quarter clock.\\n\\nThe Eagles?\\n\\nThey have the division's best quarterback. They have the division's best coach. And, on both counts, second place is not particularly close behind. For the last month, they haven't looked like the Super Bowl champs. Maybe they still don't. But they don't look like they are getting there.\\n\\n\\\"We were close,\\\" tight end Zach Ertz said. \\\"We just weren't sustaining it for four quarters. Hopefully this will spark us.\\\"\\n\\nIn this division, they have as much margin for error as any team in the league.\\n\\nPublished: October 12, 2018 â\\\" 12:22 AM EDT View Comments Close Comments\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"East Rutherford, New Jersey\"","lat":40,"lng":-74,"__v":0}

(AP) - Carlos Bacca, Radamel Falcao and Miguel Borja scored second-half goals to lead Colombia over the United States 4-2 on Thursday night in an exhibition that marked the return of American captain Michael Bradley to the national team following a one-year absence.\\n\\nJames Rodriguez put Colombia ahead with a pretty curling shot from just inside the penalty area in the 36th, but the U.S. regrouped and took a 2-1 lead on goals by Kellyn Acosta in the 50th minute and Bobby Wood in the 53rd.\\n\\nBacca tied the score three minutes later, and Falcao put Colombia ahead in the 74th on a counterattack begun by Rodriguez's clearance that went nearly half the length of the field. Borja scored on a scissors kick while falling in the 79th.\\n\\nThe U.S. has three wins, three losses and three ties under interim coach Dave Sarachan, who also will lead the team for Tuesday's exhibition against Peru in East Hartford, Connecticut. A new coach is expected to be hired later this year, and Gregg Berhalter of Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew is the favorite.\\n\\nThe Americans had not allowed four goals since 4-0 loss at Costa Rica in a November 2016 World Cup qualifier that caused the U.S. Soccer Federation to fire coach Jurgen Klinsmann and bring back Bruce Arena.\\n\\n\\\"We let ourselves down a little bit in terms of that middle part of the second half,\\\" Bradley said.\\n\\nBradley was dropped from the national team along with most veterans after the loss at Trinidad and Tobago on Oct. 10 last year that ended the Americans' streak of seven straight World Cup appearances.

When he was younger he would spend time on Google and Facebook searching for it, just to make sure he still had it all to himself. He has never met another Nakobe.\\n\\nThe Horn Lake senior is the top-rated inside linebacker in the nation for the Class of 2019, according to the 247Sports composite ranking, the top-rated player in Mississippi and the No. 15 player overall in the nation.\\n\\nBut he's also a straight-A student and mentors at-risk youth in his hometown of Tunica, Mississippi.\\n\\n\\\"It's almost like he's a kid that's living his teenage years for the second time, because you think about you and I if we were 17 again how we would do things,\\\" said Horn Lake coach Brad Boyette. \\\"But that's the way he is. You know how the typical 17-year-old might be looking to lay down and eat a bag of chips or something like that, well that doesn't figure into his day. He has a purpose for every second.\\\"\\n\\nRELATED: 2019 Chosen 25 Football Player Rankings\\n\\nIf you want to know who Nakobe Dean is, all you have to do is ask him.\\n\\n\\\"Nakobe Dean is a real cool guy,\\\" Dean said with a smile. \\\"He can be chill, he likes to have fun also. He can be intense at times but he is about his business.\\\"\\n\\nHow Nakobe Dean got his name\\n\\nDean is the middle child of three. His older brother, Nikolas, plays tight end at Ole Miss.\\n\\n\\\"If I had to pick one person who would keep this family together if things were to go wrong, it would be him,\\\" said Nakobe. \\\"He's a real family guy and he's going to take care of his folks.\\\"\\n\\nHis younger sister, Brooklyn, is his trusted confidant.\\n\\n\\\"I talk to my little sister every day,\\\" said Dean. \\\"About almost anything to be honest.\\\"\\n\\nThe brothers share the \\\"nic\\\" sound in their first names with their mother, Neketta, who wanted to name them after herself. She was always fond of the name Kobe, so she added the \\\"na\\\" in front of it to keep with the theme. She calls Dean \\\"Kobe\\\" for short. She also calls him \\\"Kobear\\\" because of his teddy bear-like affection for her.\\n\\n\\\"You know, I'm a mama's boy,\\\" said Dean. \\\"I love my mama. We have a great relationship.\\\"\\n\\nHis parents divorced when he was just a year old, and Neketta has raised the children on her own. The kids were aware of their father, Byron, growing up, but didn't see him much. He's a physician who owns a practice in Florida.\\n\\nDean plans on studying engineering but also said that he wants to become a doctor one day like his dad.\\n\\nNeketta was the Director of Community Affairs and Public Relations for the Tunica County government until she retired in 2015. She spent as much of her free time as possible with her kids, instilling discipline in them while trying to keep things fun.\\n\\nFreestyle Fridays were highly anticipated because they marked the start of the weekend and the rules loosened up a bit. It meant that the kids could do things that weren't allowed during the week such as eating junk food and playing video games.\\n\\nNeketta would also reward her children with cash for strong academic performance. From eighth grade on, a straight-A report card was worth $100. Just one B would drop the reward down to $25.\\n\\n\\\"And he (Dean) would tell me \\\"if I get a B, I don't want anything,\\\" said Neketta. \\\"Don't give me anything if I get a B. He was just determined.\\\"\\n\\nSaid Dean: \\\"I feel like what makes me different from most people is my mindset, the way I approach things and look at things. I look at it from a business standpoint and a moral standpoint because of how my mama taught me when I was younger. She taught me almost everything I know.\\\"\\n\\nNeketta got an early glimpse at that determination when Nakobe was in third grade. They would play Scrabble together and Nakobe could never beat her, until one day he surprised her with a word that she didn't know he knew. He had been looking up words in a thesaurus, and she doesn't quite remember which word led him to victory that night, but she remembers the feeling.\\n\\n\\\"And when he said it, I was like, 'That's not right,' and he was like, 'Yeah, look it up, look it up,' because we used to challenge each other,\\\" she said. \\\"And sure enough it was right.\\\"\\n\\nWhere will Nakobe Dean go to school?\\n\\nDean grew up playing football, basketball and baseball. His football instincts manifested early, during pee-wee flag football at age 5, where he was already making tackles.\\n\\n\\\"They (the coaches) were like, 'You can't tackle Kobe, you can't tackle. You just gotta pull the flags,\\\" said Neketta. \\\"So, he started from there.\\\"\\n\\nDean played on the Horn Lake basketball team his freshman year, but quickly realized that scrapping in the post as a 6-foot \\\"big man\\\" wasn't the best possible use of his time, even though ESPN lists his 41.2-inch vertical leap as the best at his position in the country. He figured he could focus more on football if he dropped it, so he did.\\n\\nThat spring, Dean was fighting for a starting spot on the baseball team when he broke his left wrist diving for a fly ball the week before the season started. He sat out the season and played his sophomore season but then focused on playing only football.\\n\\nDean made the varsity football team his freshman year, but the attention from college coaches didn't start pouring in until his sophomore season. So far he has officially visited Alabama, and according to 247Sports has an official visit scheduled with LSU on Dec. 7. Dean says his list is down to his top seven schools and that there are no frontrunners.\\n\\n\\\"They're all even.

The message to Republican voters: Democrats are employing radical tactics that are only growing worse.\\n\\n\\\"Only one side was happy to play host to this toxic fringe behavior,\\\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday in the latest GOP attack. \\\"Only one side's leaders are now openly calling for more of it. They haven't seen enough. They want more. And I'm afraid this is only Phase One of the meltdown.\\\"\\n\\nWhile the demonstrations were intense and some Republicans reported personal threats, liberal protesters' tactics were broadly in line with those used by groups on the left and right during particularly passionate moments in Washington. The confrontational style harkened back to protests by the conservative tea party, which included angry face-offs with lawmakers and a massive Capitol demonstration far larger than last week's rallies.\\n\\nIt's not unusual for Republicans and Democrats alike to sharpen their rhetoric as elections approach in hopes of drawing loyal voters to the polls. But the GOP shift to disparaging descriptions of their opponents as unruly and sinister is a marked change from their messaging before the Kavanaugh battle, when they'd hoped to focus on the strong economy and the mammoth tax cut they pushed through Congress last December.\\n\\nBoth parties have detected a surge in engagement among GOP and conservative voters since the nation's attention was grabbed by the confirmation battle over Kavanaugh, including allegations of sexual misconduct that he denied. While no one knows if that energy will last until Election Day, Democratic voters driven by an animus toward Trump until now were far more motivated.\\n\\nTop Republicans have acknowledged that television scenes of anti-Kavanaugh protesters berating senators and interrupting Senate debate have helped them.\\n\\n\\\"It's turned our base on fire,\\\" McConnell said about the battle, which he's called a political gift. Focusing on the \\\"mob\\\" has also let Republicans raise the subject without explicitly reminding voters about Kavanaugh himself, who polling showed was viewed unfavorably by the public.\\n\\nSo far, Republicans have shown no signs of abandoning that focus.\\n\\n\\\"The Democrats are willing to do anything, to hurt anyone, to get the power they so desperately crave,\\\" Trump said at a rally in Minnesota last week. He added, \\\"They want to destroy.\\\"\\n\\nDemocrats argue that the party of Trump and the conservative tea party has nerve to decry such behavior.\\n\\n\\\"The last time I looked, the mocker-in-chief is in the White House,\\\" said Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. Trump drew fresh ire last week when he ridiculed Christine Blasey Ford, the first of Kavanaugh's three women accusers.\\n\\nDemocrats say Trump's rhetoric since launching his 2016 campaign has been provocative, pugnacious and at times racist. They cite numerous comments about Mexicans, Muslims, African countries. They also noted his statement that there were \\\"very fine people on both sides\\\" after an anti-Nazi demonstrator was killed by a white supremacist at a violent 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\\n\\nNo. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois said Thursday that his response to GOP accusations of Democratic mob tactics \\\"is to say three words: 'Lock her up.'\\\"\\n\\nCrowds at Trump campaign rallies have long chanted that about 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. They've aimed it in recent days at Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who some Republicans have accused of leaking Ford's letter claiming sexual assault by Kavanaugh. Feinstein has denied the leak.\\n\\nGrass roots tea party activists opposed to President Barack Obama's health care bill noisily disrupted lawmakers' town hall meetings across the country in summer 2009, booing and accusing Democrats of lying. One man in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, told a lawmaker that God will \\\"judge you and the rest of your damned cronies on the Hill,\\\" while a Boston woman demanded to know, \\\"Why do you continue to support a Nazi policy?\\\"\\n\\nThat September, tens of thousands of tea party demonstrators ringed the Capitol to protest the health care law and what they considered a wasteful, oversized federal government. That crowd, which dwarfed the hundreds or several thousand anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators, vented anger at times, shouting \\\"Liar, liar\\\" and waving sings including one saying, \\\"Bury Obama Care with Kennedy,\\\" a reference to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who had recently died.\\n\\nBlack lawmakers said they were targeted by racial epithets and spat upon during a smaller rally by several thousand tea party supporters in March 2010, as Congress was voting on the health care legislation.\\n\\nIn remarks Thursday, McConnell described last week's anti-Kavanaugh protesters as \\\"literally storming the steps of the Capitol and the Supreme Court,\\\" confronting Republicans at restaurants and airports and shouting from visitors' galleries during Senate debates. Republicans have said some received death threats and were stalked at their homes.\\n\\nMcConnell criticized Clinton, who said on CNN this week that \\\"civility can start again\\\" after Democrats capture the House or Senate in next month's elections.\\n\\nHe also criticized former Attorney General Eric Holder. In a video purportedly shot at a recent campaign event in Georgia, Holder says, \\\"When they go low, we kick them,\\\" paraphrasing former first lady Michelle Obama, who famously said during the 2016 campaign, \\\"When they go low, we go high.\\\"\\n\\nMcConnell noted that these activities followed last year's shooting of GOP lawmakers at a morning baseball practice by \\\"a politically crazed gunman.\\\"\\n\\nGunman James Hodgkinson, killed at the scene by officers, was infuriated by Trump's election. His social media posts suggest he targeted Republicans because of his political views.\\n\\nAP researcher Rhonda Shafner and reporters Steve Peoples and Kevin Freking contributed.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

When it landed, one of the legs tore through the roof, fatally striking the 11-year-old girl in the head.\\n\\nMichael dropped from a Category 4 hurricane to a Category 1 as it arrived in Georgia, and later weakened to a tropical storm. Still, it caused havoc in parts of the state, spinning off tornadoes and leaving downed trees, damaged buildings and power outages behind as it marched toward the Carolinas.\\n\\nSarah had the week off from school for fall break and she and her 12-year-old brother had been staying at their grandparents' house near a lake in Seminole County since Monday. They were supposed to return home Thursday morning.\\n\\nAt home in Cairo about 45 miles (70 kilometers) away, Sarah's father and stepmother, Roy and Amber Radney, kept in touch with her grandparents through frequent phone calls as the storm winds gusted around them.\\n\\nRoy Radney was outside Wednesday evening when the call came that something had come through the roof and hit Sarah and his mother. Sarah had been struck in the face, couldn't breathe and quickly fell unconscious.\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later, Amber Radney called her father-in-law and learned Sarah was gone.\\n\\nEmergency responders weren't able to reach the home until after midnight because power lines and trees blocked the roads. When they finally made it, they took Sarah's grandmother to a hospital, where she was treated for a punctured lung, a broken rib and flesh wounds, Amber Radney said.\\n\\nThe youngest of four until her father remarried and had two more daughters, Sarah loved being around her big family and made everything more fun, Roy and Amber Radney said in phone interviews with The Associated Press on Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"We couldn't ever get her to spend the night nowhere because she always wanted to be home with her family,\\\" Roy Radney said. \\\"She was 11 years old, but she liked to have fun like a 5-year-old.\\\"\\n\\nSarah loved to perform, her father said. When she started sixth grade this year, she began playing the trumpet in the school band and had recently been in a play with the drama club.\\n\\nAmber Radney said one of her favorite memories is of making a video of Sarah dancing to Outkast's \\\"Hey Ya!\\\" in a park about two years ago.\\n\\n\\\"She was so beautiful and she smiled so much that day,\\\" Amber Radney said. \\\"She lit up everything.\\\"\\n\\nOther parts of Georgia also were hit hard by the storm. National Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Willis said there were two confirmed tornado touchdowns in the state: one in southwest Atlanta and another in Crawford County in central Georgia.\\n\\nWillis said the Atlanta-area tornado was an EF0, the lowest intensity rating for a tornado, with sustained winds of 65 to 85 mph (105 to 137 kph). The damage there consisted mostly of fallen trees.\\n\\nWillis said that a team was still working in Crawford County to assess the damage and intensity of the tornado.\\n\\nIn Roberta, in Crawford County, Hill Bentley said he saw spinning clouds that looked like a tornado Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"I told my wife, Judy, 'Come on out, you want to see what a tornado looks like?'\\\"\\n\\nBentley's home wasn't hit, but his friend Bradley Lewis wasn't so lucky. Dozens of fallen pines littered Lewis' front and back yards, and his roof and back porch were damaged. Luckily, he was not injured.\\n\\n\\\"Kaboom!

But, seated across from President Donald Trump at the Resolute Desk, the musician delivered a rambling, multipart monologue Thursday that touched on social issues, hydrogen planes, mental health, endorsement deals, politics and oh so much more.\\n\\nSeizing the spotlight from the typically center-stage president, West dropped the F-word, floated policy proposals -- and went in for a hug.\\n\\n\\\"They tried to scare me to not wear this hat,\\\" West said of his red \\\"Make America Great Again\\\" cap. But, he said, \\\"This hat, it gives me power in a way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You made a Superman cape for me,\\\" he told Trump.\\n\\nIt was a surreal scene even by the standards of a nonconventional White House. The unlikely allies spoke to reporters before a closed-door lunch that had been billed as a forum to discuss policy issues including manufacturing, gangs, prison reform and violence in Chicago, where West grew up. Spectators at the show included Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, former NFL star Jim Brown, the attorney for a gang leader serving time in federal prison, and a gaggle of reporters.\\n\\nDuring one pause, Trump seemed to acknowledge the oddness of the moment, saying, \\\"That was quite something.\\\"\\n\\nWest's mental health has been a question of speculation since he was hospitalized in 2016. In a bizarre performance last month on \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" he delivered an unscripted pro-Trump message after the credits rolled.\\n\\nAddressing the topic Thursday, West said he had at one point been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but was later told by a neuropsychologist he'd been misdiagnosed.\\n\\n\\\"So he said that I actually wasn't bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe conversation began with an exchange on North Korea among Trump, Brown and West. Trump said the region was headed for war before he took over, and West commended him for stopping it. Brown said he liked North Korea; Trump agreed.\\n\\nFrom there, West discussed prison reform and violence in inner-city Chicago. He brought up Larry Hoover, the leader of the Gangster Disciples who is serving a life sentence for murder, claiming: \\\"The reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around.\\\"\\n\\nWest said he \\\"loved Hillary\\\" Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic rival, because he loves everyone, but said he connected with Trump's \\\"male energy.\\\" He also criticized the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, calling it a \\\"trap door.\\\"\\n\\nHolding out his phone, West showed Trump a picture of a hydrogen-powered plane that he thought should replace Air Force One.\\n\\n\\\"This right here is the iPlane 1,\\\" he said. \\\"This is what our president should be flying.\\\"\\n\\nAdded West: \\\"If he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our president. He has to be the freshest, the flyest\\\" and have \\\"the flyest planes.\\\"\\n\\nWest also had a sartorial suggestion for Trump, proposing a hat that says just \\\"Make America Great\\\" -- dropping the \\\"again.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of West's lengthy, sometimes-hard-to-follow dialogue, even Trump seemed at a loss.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you what: That was pretty impressive,\\\" the president said.\\n\\n\\\"It was from the soul,\\\" West replied. \\\"I just channeled it.\\\"\\n\\nWest later told reporters of his verbal stylings: \\\"You are tasting a fine wine that has multiple notes to it. You better play 4D chess with me. ... It's complex.\\\"\\n\\nTaking questions from reporters, the rapper also voiced concern about stop-and-frisk policing. Trump this week called on Chicago to embrace the tactic, which allowed police to detain, question and search civilians without probable cause, though it was deemed unconstitutional in New York City because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents.\\n\\nTrump said they'd discuss the matter and he'd keep an open mind.\\n\\nAsked about his comments in 2005 that President George W. Bush didn't \\\"care about black people\\\" after Hurricane Katrina, West said that \\\"We need to care about all people\\\" and that he \\\"was programed to think in a victimized mentality.\\\"\\n\\nTrump and West previously appeared together shortly after Trump's 2016 election in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York.\\n\\nAsked what the two had talked about during their December meeting, West responded briefly that time: \\\"Life. We discussed life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Trump has been shunned by much of the Hollywood establishment, he has a fan in West, who tweeted earlier this year that the two share \\\"dragon energy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother,\\\" West wrote.\\n\\nWest is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, who successfully pushed Trump to grant a pardon to a drug offender earlier this year.\\n\\nWest himself has suggested he might be open to wading into politics, including a run for president in 2020.\\n\\nAsked if West could be a future presidential candidate, Trump said, \\\"Could very well be.\\\" West shot back, \\\"Only after 2024.\\\"\\n\\nAfter all that, the president brought the show to a close by suggesting, \\\"Let's go have some lunch, OK?\\\"\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

En ésta resaltan los estampados que fueron obra de la artista asturiana María Abascal, mostrando bordados y algunos negros que intentan emular a las algas\\\", declaró Luengo a Acan-Efe.\\n\\nAdemás, se resalta la silueta de la mujer en atardeceres evocadores, paisajes desérticos y milenarios y se convierte en la protagonista del momento mágico donde el desierto se convierte en mar, dando como resultado una colección en tonos empolvados, pasando de los colores tierra y blancos a los azules del mar, el verde agua, los malvas, tonalidades brillantes y metalizadas.\\n\\nEste diseñador -formado en psicología que, tras años dedicado a la enseñanza, decidió apostar por sus verdaderas pasiones: el arte y el diseño- mostró además su encanto por la moda latinoamericana, en la que asegura que en las raíces y tradiciones están las verdaderas esencias de este segmento en el continente.\\n\\n\\\"Creo que los nuevos diseñadores latinoamericanos deben tener sus raíces muy fuertes, porque sin ellas no se pueden crecer, necesitan interiorizar lo que son y lo que pueden ofrecer a un mundo tremendamente competitivo\\\", declaró Luengo.\\n\\nManifestó que estas mentes emergentes de los textiles deberían ser conscientes del potencial que tienen las tradiciones si modernizan sus técnicas, para que puedan exportar a otros mercados.\\n\\nCabe destacar, que en cada temporada Luengo presenta colecciones para la mujer construidas en base a siluetas fluidas que respetan el cuerpo sin ignorar las formas. Y en ellas siempre reserva un espacio central para los complementos: bolsos, estolas, cuellos y sombreros de pelo y napa que anclan la firma a sus raíces.\\n\\nOtra cara española presente en la pasarela fue Pilar Sáinz, quien es reconocida en el mundo de la alta costura por sus exclusivos vestidos de novia, pero que en esta ocasión dejó ver una muestra con una paleta de colores vivos como el rojo, el amarillo y el azulón.\\n\\nSu colección \\\"Puerta del Sol\\\", hace alusión a una plaza emblemática de la ciudad de Madrid. En ella se encuentra desde 1950 el denominado kilómetro cero. Para Sáinz este kilómetro es símbolo de unión de diferentes culturas, diversidad y apertura ideológica.\\n\\nPara enmarcar sus creaciones ha utilizado texturas de crepé, seda y triacetato. Incluso en este desfile de moda la diseñadora española mostró prendas con diversos cortes y volúmenes. Y como marca destacable, realzó el tocado de la cabeza, tipo turbantes, a juego con su colección.\\n\\nEl Fashion Week Panamá es considerada por ser referencia global de la moda en la región, encargada de crear vínculos entre las industrias de manufactura locales e internacionales. Este evento internacional, además, impulsa el talento y crea relaciones estratégicas entre diseñadores, buyers, marcas globales y representantes de cada una de las áreas en el campo de la moda.\\n\\nLa plataforma que muestra lo nuevo de la temporada de la moda, se extenderá hasta el domingo, y busca desarrollar una expansión global de talento, incentivando y llevando la cultura latinoamericana de la moda hacia nuevas latitudes.

He has pleaded not guilty and denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. He is free on $1 million bail and is due back in court Dec. 20.\\n\\nProsecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon insisted the rest of the case is strong and said that the district attorney's office was looking into the possibility of bringing additional charges against the 66-year-old Weinstein.\\n\\n\\\"In short, your honor, we are moving full steam ahead,\\\" she said.\\n\\nProsecutors said in a letter unsealed Oct. 11 that they learned weeks ago that a woman who was with Evans the night she met Weinstein had given the police detective a contradictory account of what happened, but the detective had instructed her to keep quiet, telling her that \\\"less is more.\\\"\\n\\nThe woman, prosecutors said, told the detective in February that Weinstein had offered them money to flash their breasts during the restaurant encounter. They initially declined but Evans later told her she had gone ahead and exposed herself to the film producer in a hallway.\\n\\nThe woman also told the detective -- identified by Weinstein's lawyer as Nicholas DiGaudio -- that sometime after Evans' office meeting with Weinstein, she had suggested what happened was consensual. Weinstein had promised to get her an acting job if she agreed to perform oral sex and she agreed.\\n\\nAccording to the witness, who was not named in the court filing, Evans had been drinking and \\\"appeared to be upset, embarrassed and shaking\\\" when she told the story.\\n\\nEvans was among the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual assault.\\n\\nIn an expose published in The New Yorker one year ago Oct. 10, Evans accused Weinstein of forcing her to perform oral sex when they met alone in his office in 2004 to discuss her fledgling acting career. At the time, Evans was a 21-year-old college student. She said she had initially met Weinstein at a restaurant in Manhattan earlier that summer.\\n\\nProsecutors also disclosed that they had discovered a draft email that Evans had written three years ago to a man who is now her husband that \\\"describes details of the sexual assault that differ from the account\\\" she provided to investigators.\\n\\nEvans' lawyer, Carrie Goldberg, furiously said outside court that her client had been abandoned by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for no reason.\\n\\n\\\"Let me be clear: the decision to throw away my client's sexual assault charges says nothing about Weinstein's guilt or innocence. Nor does it reflect on Lucia's consistent allegation that she was sexually assaulted with force by Harvey Weinstein,\\\" she said in a written statement. \\\"It only speaks volumes about the Manhattan DA's office and its mishandling of my client's case.\\\"\\n\\nShe insisted Evans has told the truth and disputed that she either showed Weinstein her breasts or misled investigators.\\n\\nWeinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told the judge he believed Evans had lied both to the grand jury and to The New Yorker about her encounter with Weinstein.\\n\\n\\\"The integrity of these proceedings has been compromised,\\\" he said. Outside court, he suggested that Evans should be prosecuted criminally for perjury.\\n\\n\\\"This is an attack on the fundamental integrity of the grand jury process. If you have a person willing to commit perjury in the grand jury, that is as serious as the crime of sexual assault because it undermines the fairness of the process for all of us.\\\"\\n\\nGoldberg said Evans told the grand jury the truth.\\n\\n\\\"The DA is aware of robust evidence, including witnesses, that seriously undermine the witness' credibility and recollection of events. Yet, the DA consented to dismissal prior to investigating this evidence,\\\" she wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nThe New Yorker, in a statement, said that it stands by its reporting and fact-checking process and that \\\"any assertion by lawyers for Harvey Weinstein that The New Yorker had information that contradicted Lucia Evans's account is patently incorrect.\\\"\\n\\nPolice said Oct. 11 that DiGaudio, who had been outspoken in the media about wanting Weinstein charged, is being investigated by the department and no longer has an active role in the Weinstein probe.\\n\\n\\\"We take these allegations seriously,\\\" Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said.\\n\\nA message left on a phone used by the detective in the past wasn't immediately returned. The union representing New York City police detectives also didn't immediately return a message.\\n\\nImages of Weinstein in handcuffs were seen by many women as a cathartic moment in the #MeToo reckoning. The collapse of part of the case against him could mean trouble for the prosecutor.\\n\\nVance has already been fiercely criticized for declining to prosecute Weinstein when an Italian model accused him of grabbing her breasts in 2015. At the time, Vance cited a lack of supporting evidence, despite the existence of a clandestinely made recording of Weinstein discussing the episode with the woman.\\n\\nIn the months after The New York Times and The New Yorker began publishing stories about Weinstein's interactions with women, activists pressured Vance to bring charges as dozens of people came forward with claims of sexual misconduct against him.\\n\\nNew York Police officials poured on the pressure, too, saying publicly that they believed they had gathered ample evidence to make an arrest.\\n\\nThe Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly, as Evans has done.\\n\\nBy Michael R.

The storm also has brought flash flooding to hurricane-weary parts of the Carolinas and Virginia .\\n\\nBY THE NUMBERS\\n\\n-- Hurricane history: first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Florida's Panhandle since record-keeping began in 1851.\\n\\n-- Top winds: 155 mph (250 kph), strong enough to completely destroy homes and cause weekslong power outages.\\n\\n-- Powerful pressure: 919 millibars minimum pressure in the eye, the third most intense hurricane landfall in the U.S. in recorded history.\\n\\n-- High water: estimated peak storm surge of 9 feet (2.75 meters) and 14 feet (4.25 meters) from Mexico Beach east through Apalachee Bay, according to the National Hurricane Center\\n\\n-- Storm riders: Roughly 375,000 people in Florida warned to evacuate; many refused, including 285 people in Mexico Beach where Michael made landfall.\\n\\n-- Rescued: 47 helped out of hard-hit areas along Florida's coastline, and 20 people in flooded neighborhoods in North Carolina.\\n\\n-- Staying safe: nearly 6,700 people took refuge in 54 shelters in Florida.\\n\\n-- Power outages: Roughly a million customers in Georgia, Florida, Alabama and South Carolina lost power.\\n\\n-- Food and water: 2 million ready-to-eat meals, 1 million gallons (3.75 million liters) of water and 40,000 10-pound (4.5-kilogram) bags of ice ready for distribution in Florida.\\n\\n-- The human cost: Falling trees have killed a man in Gadsden County, Florida; a man in Iredell County, North Carolina; and an 11-year-old girl in Seminole County, Georgia, was killed when a carport blew through the roof of her home.\\n\\n-- Damage estimates: Boston-based Karen Clark \u0026 Company, an insurance company that produces models for catastrophes, is estimating Hurricane Michael caused about $8 billion in insured losses. It includes the privately insured wind and storm surge damage to residential, commercial and industrial properties and automobiles. The figure does not include losses covered by the National Flood Insurance Program.\\n\\nIMAGES of DESTRUCTION\\n\\nImages captured by Associated Press journalists show the devastation left in Hurricane Michael's wake.\\n\\nMEXICO BEACH\\n\\nOne of the hardest-hit spots in Florida is Mexico Beach , where Michael crashed ashore. In a beach town home about 1,000 people, entire blocks of homes have been reduced to nothing but concrete slabs in the sand or piles of splintered lumber.\\n\\nFLASH FLOODING\\n\\nMichael left North Carolina behind with rivers rising and more than 530,000 households in the dark. The power outages were concentrated in central North Carolina's Piedmont region, where motorists had to be rescued Thursday from cars trapped by high water. Flashing flooding also was reported in the big North Carolina cities of Charlotte and Raleigh. Similar scenes played out in parts of Virginia as the storm raced seaward.\\n\\nHOSPITALS EVACUATED\\n\\nThe largest hospitals in Panama City shut down and evacuated hundreds of patients due to heavy hurricane damage. Bay Medical Sacred Heart was moving about 200 patients from buildings with blown-out windows, a cracked exterior wall and a collapsed roof. State officials say Florida's largest psychiatric hospital has been \\\"entirely cut off.\\\" Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee has been running on emergency generators. A helicopter dropped water and food at the facility on Thursday after a tree downed during the storm caused a water line to break.\\n\\nBASE CLOSURE\\n\\nTyndall Air Force Base in Florida is closed while officials assess what they're calling \\\"widespread catastrophic damage.\\\" No injuries were reported, but there's roof damage to \\\"nearly every home\\\" on the base.\\n\\nNO EXTENSION\\n\\nA federal judge rejected a push by Democrats to extend Florida's voter registration deadline , which was Tuesday, by a week. Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner told local election supervisors that if their offices were closed due to the hurricane, they could accept paper applications when their offices reopen.\\n\\nDAMAGED CROPS\\n\\nGeorgia's Department of Agriculture Commissioner Gary W. Black said crops, animals and infrastructure have all taken a substantial loss because of the storm. Black says poultry contributes $23.3 billion to Georgia's economy and has reported the most widespread power outages and losses. Intense winds also hurt cotton crops.\\n\\nSTORMY WEATHER\\n\\nMichael isn't alone. The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Leslie and Tropical Storm Nadine are no threat to land over the open Atlantic Ocean, but Tropical Storm Sergio in the Pacific is blowing toward Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.\\n\\nFor the latest on Hurricane Michael, visit https://www.apnews.com/tag/Hurricanes\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Miami\"","lat":25,"lng":-80,"__v":0}

Boats were tossed like toys. The streets closest to the water looked as if a bomb had gone off.\\n\\nWhat the 9-foot (2.7-meter) storm surge didn't destroy, the 155 mph (250 kph) winds finished off.\\n\\nNow, rescuers and residents are struggling to get into the ground-zero town to assess the damage and search for the hundreds of people believed to have stayed behind.\\n\\nLinda Marquardt, 67, rode out the storm with her husband at their home in Mexico Beach. When the house filled with storm surge water, they fled upstairs.\\n\\n\\\"All of my furniture was floating,\\\" she said Thursday. \\\"A river just started coming down the road. It was awful, and now there's just nothing left.\\\"\\n\\nDrone footage of Mexico Beach showed a stunning landscape of devastation. Few structures were unscathed.\\n\\nJohn Humphress, a storm chaser and drone pilot, arrived around 5 p.m. Wednesday, a few hours after Michael slammed into the coastline.

At one particularly violent point in the storm, Vickers looked out the window and thought a tree was moving -- but it was really her house, ripped off the foundation.\\n\\nIt was floating in the storm surge.\\n\\nAn Associated Press reporter found Vickers and her family sitting next to a convenience store with blown-out windows Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"Our house would have probably been in the canal if it hadn't gotten caught on some trees that fell,\\\" said 17-year-old Ryder Vickers, adding that the home split in two, like an egg.\\n\\nOnce the water receded, they climbed out a window, onto another house and over a boat, but because Dawn Vickers' mother Patsy has a lung disease, they couldn't go far. The four spent the night in one half of the waterlogged home.\\n\\n\\\"I've never been so scared in my life,\\\" said Dawn Vickers. \\\"We were all praying, 'Just please get us through this.'

Some operate vacation home rentals, while others work jobs cleaning and maintaining the homes. Others own or work in restaurants, rent out kayaks or run charter fishing boats. LaFountain himself has a lawn-mowing business.\\n\\nDespite the widespread destruction, LaFountain said he believes most people will rebuild.\\n\\n\\\"I think the people here have a great heart and a lot of resilience.

When it landed, one of the legs tore through the roof, fatally striking the 11-year-old girl in the head.\\n\\nMichael dropped from a Category 4 hurricane to a Category 1 as it arrived in Georgia, and later weakened to a tropical storm. Still, it caused havoc in parts of the state, spinning off tornadoes and leaving downed trees, damaged buildings and power outages behind as it marched toward the Carolinas.\\n\\nSarah had the week off from school for fall break and she and her 12-year-old brother had been staying at their grandparents' house near a lake in Seminole County since Monday. They were supposed to return home Thursday morning.\\n\\nAt home in Cairo about 45 miles (70 kilometers) away, Sarah's father and stepmother, Roy and Amber Radney, kept in touch with her grandparents through frequent phone calls as the storm winds gusted around them.\\n\\nRoy Radney was outside Wednesday evening when the call came that something had come through the roof and hit Sarah and his mother. Sarah had been struck in the face, couldn't breathe and quickly fell unconscious.\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later, Amber Radney called her father-in-law and learned Sarah was gone.\\n\\nEmergency responders weren't able to reach the home until after midnight because power lines and trees blocked the roads. When they finally made it, they took Sarah's grandmother to a hospital, where she was treated for a punctured lung, a broken rib and flesh wounds, Amber Radney said.\\n\\nThe youngest of four until her father remarried and had two more daughters, Sarah loved being around her big family and made everything more fun, Roy and Amber Radney said in phone interviews with The Associated Press on Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"We couldn't ever get her to spend the night nowhere because she always wanted to be home with her family,\\\" Roy Radney said. \\\"She was 11 years old, but she liked to have fun like a 5-year-old.\\\"\\n\\nSarah loved to perform, her father said. When she started sixth grade this year, she began playing the trumpet in the school band and had recently been in a play with the drama club.\\n\\nAmber Radney said one of her favorite memories is of making a video of Sarah dancing to Outkast's \\\"Hey Ya!\\\" in a park about two years ago.\\n\\n\\\"She was so beautiful and she smiled so much that day,\\\" Amber Radney said. \\\"She lit up everything.\\\"\\n\\nOther parts of Georgia also were hit hard by the storm. National Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Willis said there were two confirmed tornado touchdowns in the state: one in southwest Atlanta and another in Crawford County in central Georgia.\\n\\nWillis said the Atlanta-area tornado was an EF0, the lowest intensity rating for a tornado, with sustained winds of 65 to 85 mph (105 to 137 kph). The damage there consisted mostly of fallen trees.\\n\\nWillis said that a team was still working in Crawford County to assess the damage and intensity of the tornado.\\n\\nIn Roberta, in Crawford County, Hill Bentley said he saw spinning clouds that looked like a tornado Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"I told my wife, Judy, 'Come on out, you want to see what a tornado looks like?'\\\"\\n\\nBentley's home wasn't hit, but his friend Bradley Lewis wasn't so lucky.

(AP) -- Nathan MacKinnon shrugged off his hot start with the Colorado Avalanche this season by suggesting he can be better.\\n\\n\\\"It's nice for sure. I think I can play better than I am,\\\" MacKinnon said after scoring twice in a 6-1 rout of the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night. \\\"I'm just putting it in right now but I think, overall, it hasn't been the easiest year so far.\\\"\\n\\nCoach Josh Bednar agrees with his player, who has five goals and extended his season-opening scoring streak to four games.\\n\\n\\\"I feel like he's just kind of starting to hit his stride,\\\" Bednar said, before turning his attention to the Avalanche's top line rounded out by Mikko Rantanen and Gabriel Landeskog.\\n\\n\\\"If they continue to work the way they're working, and do the right things and pay attention to the process, it's going to come for them,\\\" he added.\\n\\nTyson Jost and Colin Wilson scored power-play goals 2:25 apart in a first period in which the Avalanche built a 3-0 lead on Carl Soderberg's goal with 3:30 left.\\n\\nMacKinnon scored his first of the game 28 seconds after Buffalo's Nathan Beaulieu cut Colorado's lead to 3-1 late in the second period.\\n\\nMacKinnon and Alexander Kerfoot then scored breakaway goals in the final five minutes as Colorado improved to 3-1 and bounced back from a 5-2 loss at Columbus.\\n\\nSemyon Varlamov stopped 30 shots to improve to 3-0. And Mackinnon matched the Colorado franchise record for a goal streak to open a season, set by John Mitchell three years ago.\\n\\nSabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin , the first overall draft pick this summer, got his first career point with an assist on Beaulieu's goal.\\n\\nOtherwise, very little went right for Buffalo (2-2), which squandered a chance to match last season's team-best three-game winning streak.\\n\\nWhatever momentum the Sabres attempted to generate were dashed with 22 second left in the first period when Kyle Okposo's goal was disallowed following a coaching challenge for goalie interference.\\n\\nOfficials determined Okposo interfered with Varlamov when he crashed into the crease to convert Jack Eichel's pass. After redirecting the pass, Okposo backed into the goalie, forcing Varlamov to lift his right pad and allowing the puck to sneak in beneath it.\\n\\n\\\"I knew it was going to be probably a 50-50 one,\\\" Okposo said. \\\"I don't think me being there really affected it. But they did. And that's how it goes.\\\"\\n\\nOkposo was more frustrated over how Buffalo started the game.\\n\\n\\\"I think it would've been nice to get out of there 3-1, but we deserved to be down 3-0,\\\" he said. \\\"We didn't play well in the first period. Like, it was bad.\\\"\\n\\nBuffalo's bad breaks were compounded after Beaulieu scored.\\n\\nMacKinnon scored to regain Colorado's three-goal edge after a Sabres clearing attempt got caught up referee Francis Charron's skate. The puck dribbled to Rantanen, who fed a pass through the crease to a wide-open MacKinnon.\\n\\n\\\"Last game we started out a little bit sloppy so it was something we emphasized before the game,\\\" Wilson said. \\\"We answered the bell there and stayed in our mindset the whole game.\\\"\\n\\nNOTES: Colorado converted 2 of 4 power-play opportunities, while Buffalo went 0 for 7. ... Avalanche C Vladislav Kamenev made his season debut. Acquired from Nashville in a three-team trade in November, he missed 50 games after breaking his arm in his Avalanche debut. ...

Aldrick Rosas had field goals of 33 and 21 yards.\\n\\nThis was seen as a must-win game for both teams in the weak and wide-open NFC East, and the Eagles went out and grabbed it.\\n\\nThey came into the game having scored seven points in the first quarter and they doubled that against New York.\\n\\nEli Manning was under pressure all game and finished 24 of 43 for 281 yards.\\n\\nOn the opening series, Kamu Gugier-Hill intercepted Manning's pass that was tipped by fellow linebacker Jordan Hicks and he returned it to Giants 16. Three plays later, Wentz (26 of 36 for 278 yards and no interceptions) was forced out of the pocket and found Jeffery after getting all day to throw.\\n\\nA 46-yard run by Barkley set up Rosas' 33-yarder to cut the gap to 7-3, but the Eagles took control later in the quarter after DeAndre Carter returned a punt 23 yards to the New York 44.

The storm also has brought flash flooding to hurricane-weary parts of the Carolinas and Virginia .\\n\\nBY THE NUMBERS\\n\\n-- Hurricane history: first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Florida's Panhandle since record-keeping began in 1851.\\n\\n-- Top winds: 155 mph (250 kph), strong enough to completely destroy homes and cause weekslong power outages.\\n\\n-- Powerful pressure: 919 millibars minimum pressure in the eye, the third most intense hurricane landfall in the U.S. in recorded history.\\n\\n-- High water: estimated peak storm surge of 9 feet (2.75 meters) and 14 feet (4.25 meters) from Mexico Beach east through Apalachee Bay, according to the National Hurricane Center\\n\\n-- Storm riders: Roughly 375,000 people in Florida warned to evacuate; many refused, including 285 people in Mexico Beach where Michael made landfall.\\n\\n-- Rescued: 47 helped out of hard-hit areas along Florida's coastline, and 20 people in flooded neighborhoods in North Carolina.\\n\\n-- Staying safe: nearly 6,700 people took refuge in 54 shelters in Florida.\\n\\n-- Power outages: Roughly a million customers in Georgia, Florida, Alabama and South Carolina lost power.\\n\\n-- Food and water: 2 million ready-to-eat meals, 1 million gallons (3.75 million liters) of water and 40,000 10-pound (4.5-kilogram) bags of ice ready for distribution in Florida.\\n\\n-- The human cost: Falling trees have killed a man in Gadsden County, Florida; a man in Iredell County, North Carolina; and an 11-year-old girl in Seminole County, Georgia, was killed when a carport blew through the roof of her home.\\n\\n-- Damage estimates: Boston-based Karen Clark \u0026 Company, an insurance company that produces models for catastrophes, is estimating Hurricane Michael caused about $8 billion in insured losses. It includes the privately insured wind and storm surge damage to residential, commercial and industrial properties and automobiles. The figure does not include losses covered by the National Flood Insurance Program.\\n\\nIMAGES of DESTRUCTION\\n\\nImages captured by Associated Press journalists show the devastation left in Hurricane Michael's wake.\\n\\nMEXICO BEACH\\n\\nOne of the hardest-hit spots in Florida is Mexico Beach , where Michael crashed ashore. In a beach town home about 1,000 people, entire blocks of homes have been reduced to nothing but concrete slabs in the sand or piles of splintered lumber.\\n\\nFLASH FLOODING\\n\\nMichael left North Carolina behind with rivers rising and more than 530,000 households in the dark. The power outages were concentrated in central North Carolina's Piedmont region, where motorists had to be rescued Thursday from cars trapped by high water. Flashing flooding also was reported in the big North Carolina cities of Charlotte and Raleigh. Similar scenes played out in parts of Virginia as the storm raced seaward.\\n\\nHOSPITALS EVACUATED\\n\\nThe largest hospitals in Panama City shut down and evacuated hundreds of patients due to heavy hurricane damage. Bay Medical Sacred Heart was moving about 200 patients from buildings with blown-out windows, a cracked exterior wall and a collapsed roof. State officials say Florida's largest psychiatric hospital has been \\\"entirely cut off.\\\" Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee has been running on emergency generators. A helicopter dropped water and food at the facility on Thursday after a tree downed during the storm caused a water line to break.\\n\\nBASE CLOSURE\\n\\nTyndall Air Force Base in Florida is closed while officials assess what they're calling \\\"widespread catastrophic damage.\\\" No injuries were reported, but there's roof damage to \\\"nearly every home\\\" on the base.\\n\\nNO EXTENSION\\n\\nA federal judge rejected a push by Democrats to extend Florida's voter registration deadline , which was Tuesday, by a week. Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner told local election supervisors that if their offices were closed due to the hurricane, they could accept paper applications when their offices reopen.\\n\\nDAMAGED CROPS\\n\\nGeorgia's Department of Agriculture Commissioner Gary W. Black said crops, animals and infrastructure have all taken a substantial loss because of the storm. Black says poultry contributes $23.3 billion to Georgia's economy and has reported the most widespread power outages and losses. Intense winds also hurt cotton crops.\\n\\nSTORMY WEATHER\\n\\nMichael isn't alone. The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Leslie and Tropical Storm Nadine are no threat to land over the open Atlantic Ocean, but Tropical Storm Sergio in the Pacific is blowing toward Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.\\n\\nFor the latest on Hurricane Michael, visit https://www.apnews.com/tag/Hurricanes\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Miami\"","lat":25,"lng":-80,"__v":0}

At this point there's no sophomores, juniors, seniors, it's just a team and they've all played a lot of games and they fight. They really work hard and they love each other and it's fun to watch play,\\\" said Montzingo, whose team improved to 6-3 with the win.\\n\\nPark City and Tooele both had plenty to play for heading into Thursday's game, with a first-round home playoff game a realistic goal for both.\\n\\nTooele got off to a dream start on a chilly Park City night. It marched 80 yards in 12 plays on the game's opening drive, with Nukuluve Helu capping it on a 4-yard TD plunge for an early 7-0 lead at the 6:56 mark.\\n\\nPark City answered quickly less than two minutes later as Mark McCurdy hauled in a 21-yard TD pass from Jack Skidmore, tying the game 7-7.\\n\\nIt was a sign of things to come as Tooele committed defenders to slow Park City's speedy ball carriers.\\n\\nFollowing a Tooele punt, Park City took a 14-7 lead with 9:42 remaining in the second quarter on a 2-yard TD run from Brady Baumann. The big play was a 29-yard completion to McCurdy on third and two.\\n\\nThe Skidmore-to-McCurdy connection struck again at the 6:47 mark, this time on a 70-yard touchdown pass to extend the lead to 21-7.\\n\\n\\\"They were willing to load the box up a little bit and if you're going to give us a chance with Mark we're going to take a chance on it, and he usually makes us right when we do,\\\" said Montzingo.\\n\\nMcCurdy's big night wasn't over either. After a promising Tooele drive stalled near midfield, McCurdy returned the next punt 85 yards as he raced up the sideline untouched to stretch the lead to 28-7.\\n\\n\\\"That's a big one. Anytime you get that, on top of the offense driving, what are we going to do next,\\\" said Montzingo about breaking Tooele's spirits on the punt return. \\\"I've been on the other side of that and that's a hard feeling, and it's tough to recover.\\\"\\n\\nPark City capped the spectacular first half with a two-play drive that featured a McCurdy 34-yard reception and a Paul Baynes 40-yard touchdown catch for the 35-7 halftime lead.\\n\\nSkidmore finished the first half five for five for 194 yards and three touchdowns as the Miners scored an incredible 35 points despite running only 17 offensive plays.\\n\\nTooele's defense finally got a stop on Park City's opening drive of the third quarter, with the offense capitalizing on the field position as Austin Meono caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from Kulani Iongi trimming the deficit to 35-14.\\n\\nPark City went back to work offensively though with Dylan Bauer scoring on a 6-yard run to put the game out of reach.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Park City, Utah\"","lat":40,"lng":-111,"__v":0}

But things are changing -- perhaps for the better -- for the Beetdiggers under coach Kaleo Teriipaia, who is in his second year at the helm.\\n\\nServing as strong evidence for Teriipaia's defensive approach was Friday's 18-7 win at Timpview, which saw the Beetdiggers set the tone and make big plays throughout to limit the Thunderbirds' offense.\\n\\n\\\"We wanted to send a message that Jordan is not just an offensive team anymore,\\\" Teriipaia said. \\\"We're an all-around team. Jordan is known for defense now, not just for offense.\\\"\\n\\nThe defensive unit set the tone early snuffing out two Timpview fourth-down attempts in the first half.\\n\\nThe first came on a fourth-and-goal situation from Jordan's own 2-yard line, with the T-birds leading 7-6. The second came as the first half wore down, on a fourth-and-3 situation from Jordan's 45-yard line.\\n\\n\\\"That was big-time,\\\" Teriipaia said of the defensive stops. \\\"We knew it was going to be a defensive and we had to produce or get out.\\\"\\n\\nOf course it wasn't just the defense that produced Friday. The offense, led by running back Jake Shaver, provided enough to keep the T-birds from playing behind throughout.\\n\\nShaver opened up the scoring with a 1-yard touchdown run early in the first quarter, but it was his 83-yard scamper into the end zone in the third quarter that really changed things while giving the Beetdiggers a 12-7 lead.\\n\\n\\\"That was big and Shaver has always been Mr. Consistent,\\\" Teriipaia said. \\\"Shaver is our big-play guy. He's our workhorse and we count on him quite a bit.\\\"\\n\\nFittingly it was a defensive play that sealed things up, with Quinten Kafentzis picking off a pass with 3:04 remaining to snuff out any hopes Timpview had of a comeback.\\n\\n\\\"That's a kid who has had a lot of picks,\\\" Teriipaia said.\\n\\nThe win was a big one for Jordan, who moves into a first-place tie in Region 7 with Corner Canyon, with one week remaining in the season. But it was also big with regards to what Timpview is historically and this season.\\n\\n\\\"It's a big win,\\\" Teriipaia said. \\\"I know a lot of the coaching staff here and a lot of the players. It's big for us. Our kids took it seriously and every practice this week was awesome.\\\"\\n\\nThe Beetdiggers will have to be at least as good as they were Friday to get past next week's opponent, which happens to be No. 1-ranked Corner Canyon, in a game that will determine the Region 7 championship.\\n\\nJordan will host Corner Canyon Wednesday while Timpview looks to rebound against Cottonwood on the road.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Provo, Utah\"","lat":40,"lng":-111,"__v":0}

But, seated across from President Donald Trump at the Resolute Desk, the musician delivered a rambling, multipart monologue Thursday that touched on social issues, hydrogen planes, mental health, endorsement deals, politics and oh so much more.\\n\\nSeizing the spotlight from the typically center-stage president, West dropped the F-word, floated policy proposals -- and went in for a hug.\\n\\n\\\"They tried to scare me to not wear this hat,\\\" West said of his red \\\"Make America Great Again\\\" cap. But, he said, \\\"This hat, it gives me power in a way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You made a Superman cape for me,\\\" he told Trump.\\n\\nIt was a surreal scene even by the standards of a nonconventional White House. The unlikely allies spoke to reporters before a closed-door lunch that had been billed as a forum to discuss policy issues including manufacturing, gangs, prison reform and violence in Chicago, where West grew up. Spectators at the show included Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, former NFL star Jim Brown, the attorney for a gang leader serving time in federal prison, and a gaggle of reporters.\\n\\nDuring one pause, Trump seemed to acknowledge the oddness of the moment, saying, \\\"That was quite something.\\\"\\n\\nWest's mental health has been a question of speculation since he was hospitalized in 2016. In a bizarre performance last month on \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" he delivered an unscripted pro-Trump message after the credits rolled.\\n\\nAddressing the topic Thursday, West said he had at one point been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but was later told by a neuropsychologist he'd been misdiagnosed.\\n\\n\\\"So he said that I actually wasn't bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe conversation began with an exchange on North Korea among Trump, Brown and West. Trump said the region was headed for war before he took over, and West commended him for stopping it. Brown said he liked North Korea; Trump agreed.\\n\\nFrom there, West discussed prison reform and violence in inner-city Chicago. He brought up Larry Hoover, the leader of the Gangster Disciples who is serving a life sentence for murder, claiming: \\\"The reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around.\\\"\\n\\nWest said he \\\"loved Hillary\\\" Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic rival, because he loves everyone, but said he connected with Trump's \\\"male energy.\\\" He also criticized the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, calling it a \\\"trap door.\\\"\\n\\nHolding out his phone, West showed Trump a picture of a hydrogen-powered plane that he thought should replace Air Force One.\\n\\n\\\"This right here is the iPlane 1,\\\" he said. \\\"This is what our president should be flying.\\\"\\n\\nAdded West: \\\"If he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our president. He has to be the freshest, the flyest\\\" and have \\\"the flyest planes.\\\"\\n\\nWest also had a sartorial suggestion for Trump, proposing a hat that says just \\\"Make America Great\\\" -- dropping the \\\"again.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of West's lengthy, sometimes-hard-to-follow dialogue, even Trump seemed at a loss.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you what: That was pretty impressive,\\\" the president said.\\n\\n\\\"It was from the soul,\\\" West replied. \\\"I just channeled it.\\\"\\n\\nWest later told reporters of his verbal stylings: \\\"You are tasting a fine wine that has multiple notes to it. You better play 4D chess with me. ... It's complex.\\\"\\n\\nTaking questions from reporters, the rapper also voiced concern about stop-and-frisk policing. Trump this week called on Chicago to embrace the tactic, which allowed police to detain, question and search civilians without probable cause, though it was deemed unconstitutional in New York City because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents.\\n\\nTrump said they'd discuss the matter and he'd keep an open mind.\\n\\nAsked about his comments in 2005 that President George W. Bush didn't \\\"care about black people\\\" after Hurricane Katrina, West said that \\\"We need to care about all people\\\" and that he \\\"was programed to think in a victimized mentality.\\\"\\n\\nTrump and West previously appeared together shortly after Trump's 2016 election in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York.\\n\\nAsked what the two had talked about during their December meeting, West responded briefly that time: \\\"Life. We discussed life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Trump has been shunned by much of the Hollywood establishment, he has a fan in West, who tweeted earlier this year that the two share \\\"dragon energy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother,\\\" West wrote.\\n\\nWest is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, who successfully pushed Trump to grant a pardon to a drug offender earlier this year.\\n\\nWest himself has suggested he might be open to wading into politics, including a run for president in 2020.\\n\\nAsked if West could be a future presidential candidate, Trump said, \\\"Could very well be.\\\" West shot back, \\\"Only after 2024.\\\"\\n\\nAfter all that, the president brought the show to a close by suggesting, \\\"Let's go have some lunch, OK?\\\"\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":47,"lng":-120,"__v":0}

Boats were tossed like toys. The streets closest to the water looked as if a bomb had gone off.\\n\\nWhat the 9-foot (2.7-meter) storm surge didn't destroy, the 155 mph (250 kph) winds finished off.\\n\\nNow, rescuers and residents are struggling to get into the ground-zero town to assess the damage and search for the hundreds of people believed to have stayed behind.\\n\\nLinda Marquardt, 67, rode out the storm with her husband at their home in Mexico Beach. When the house filled with storm surge water, they fled upstairs.\\n\\n\\\"All of my furniture was floating,\\\" she said Thursday. \\\"A river just started coming down the road. It was awful, and now there's just nothing left.\\\"\\n\\nDrone footage of Mexico Beach showed a stunning landscape of devastation.

I thought we were going to die.\\\"\\n\\nMishelle McPherson and her ex-husband looked for the elderly mother of a friend on Thursday. The woman lived in a small cinderblock house about 150 yards (140 meters) from the Gulf and thought she would be OK.\\n\\nHer home was reduced to crumbled blocks and pieces of floor tile.\\\"Aggy! Aggy!\\\" McPherson yelled. The only sound that came back was the echo from the half-demolished building and the pounding of the surf.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think her body would be here? Do you think it would have floated away?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nAs she walked down the street, McPherson pointed out pieces of what had been the woman's house: \\\"That's the blade from her ceiling fan. That's her floor tile.\\\"\\n\\nOn Thursday, residents who evacuated tried to return.\\n\\nThe Rev. Eddie LaFountain, pastor at First Baptist Church in Mexico Beach, was one of them. He described the place as a \\\"good family resort town\\\" that attracts visitors seeking peace and quiet rather than the spring break-like atmosphere of other communities along the 200-mile (320-kilometer) Florida Panhandle.\\n\\nMore than a third of the population of Mexico Beach is 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census, and nearly half of the housing is for seasonal or recreational use.\\n\\nMost of the full-time residents, LaFountain said, have some connection to the hospitality industry. Some operate vacation home rentals, while others work jobs cleaning and maintaining the homes. Others own or work in restaurants, rent out kayaks or run charter fishing boats. LaFountain himself has a lawn-mowing business.\\n\\nDespite the widespread destruction, LaFountain said he believes most people will rebuild.\\n\\n\\\"I think the people here have a great heart and a lot of resilience. We call them stubborn and hard-headed. I think they will be back,\\\" LaFountain said in a phone interview while driving back to Mexico Beach.\\n\\nMexico Beach is on the west end of what is sometimes called Florida's Forgotten Coast, so named because it is not heavily developed like many of the state's other shoreline areas, with their lavish homes and high-rise condos and hotels.\\n\\nU.S. Route 98 runs right along the coast, where a few beachside restaurants offer oysters and other seafood, cocktails and a view of the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nBob Tenbrunesel's home in Mexico Beach was damaged but not destroyed.

Rick Scott said the Panhandle awoke to \\\"unimaginable destruction.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So many lives have been changed forever. So many families have lost everything,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe full extent of Michael's fury was only slowly becoming clear, with some of the hardest-hit areas difficult to reach with roads blocked by debris or water. An 80-mile (130-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 10, the main east-west route, was closed.\\n\\nVideo from a drone revealed some of the worst damage in Mexico Beach, where the hurricane crashed ashore Wednesday as a Category 4 monster with 155 mph (250 kph) winds and a storm surge of 9 feet (2.7 meters).\\n\\nEntire blocks of homes near the beach were obliterated, leaving concrete slabs in the sand. Rows and rows of other homes were rendered piles of splintered lumber. Entire roofs were torn away in the town of about 1,000 people, now a scene of utter devastation.\\n\\nState officials said 285 people in Mexico Beach had defied a mandatory evacuation order ahead of Michael. More than 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast were ordered or urged to clear out as Michael closed in. But emergency authorities lamented that many ignored the warnings.\\n\\nNational Guard troops made their way into the ground-zero town and found 20 survivors Wednesday night, and more rescue crews arrived Thursday. But the fate of many residents was unknown.\\n\\nMishelle McPherson and her ex-husband searched for the elderly mother of a friend. The woman lived in a small cinderblock house about 150 yards (meters) from the Gulf and thought she would be OK. The home was found smashed, with no sign of the woman.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think her body would be here? Do you think it would have floated away?\\\" McPherson asked.\\n\\nLinda Marquardt, 67, rode out the storm with her husband at their home in Mexico Beach. When the house filled with storm surge water, they fled upstairs. \\\"All of my furniture was floating,\\\" she said. \\\"\\\"A river just started coming down the road. It was awful, and now there's just nothing left.\\\"\\n\\nAs thousands of National Guard troops, law enforcement officers and medical teams spread out, the governor pleaded with people in the devastated areas to stay away because of hazards such as fallen trees and power lines.\\n\\n\\\"I know you just want to go home. You want to check on things and begin the recovery process,\\\" Scott said. But \\\"we have to make sure things are safe.\\\"\\n\\nMore than 900,000 homes and businesses in Florida, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas were without power.\\n\\nThe Coast Guard said it rescued at least 27 people before and after the hurricane's landfall, mostly from coastal homes. Nine people had to be rescued by helicopter from a bathroom of a home in hard-hit Panama City after their roof collapsed, Petty Officer 3rd Class Ronald Hodges said.\\n\\nIn Panama City, most homes were still standing, but no property was left undamaged. Downed power lines and twisted street signs lay all around. Roofs had been peeled off. Aluminum siding was shredded and homes were split by fallen trees. Hundreds of cars had broken windows. Pine trees were stripped and snapped off about 20 feet (7 meters) high.\\n\\nIn neighboring Panama City Beach, Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford reported widespread looting of homes and businesses. He imposed a curfew and asked for 50 members of the National Guard for protection.\\n\\nThe hurricane also damaged hospitals and nursing homes in the Panama City area, and officials worked to evacuate hundreds of patients. The damage at Bay Medical Sacred Heart included blown-out windows and a cracked exterior wall though no patients were hurt.\\n\\nThe state mental hospital in Chattahoochee, which has a section for the criminally insane, was cut off by land, and food and supplies were being flown in, authorities said. All phone communicaiton was cut off to the complex of nearly 1,000 residents and more than 300 staff, leaving emergency radios as their only link out.\\n\\nA man outside Tallahassee, Florida, was killed by a falling tree, and an 11-year-old girl in Georgia died when the winds picked up a carport and dropped it on her home. One of the carport's legs punctured the roof and hit her in the head. A driver in North Carolina was killed when a tree fell on his car.\\n\\nAs the storm charged north, it spun off possible tornadoes and downed power lines and trees in Georgia. Forecasters said it could drop up to 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain over the Carolinas and Virginia before pushing out to sea in coming hours. Street flooding was reported in Roanoke and other southwestern Virginia cities that reported motorists caught in flooding had to be rescued.\\n\\nIn North Carolina's mountains, drivers also had to be plucked from cars in high water. Michael's winds also toppled trees and power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and flash flooding also was reported in North Carolina's two largest cities, Charlotte and Raleigh.\\n\\nForecasters said Michael was still a potent tropical storm Thursday evening, centered about 5 miles (8 kilometers) northwest of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, and packing top sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph). It was racing to the northeast at 24 mph (39 kph) amid warnings it could spread damaging winds and more flash flooding in the region before moving offshore.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida; Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida; Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Jennifer Kay and Freida Frisaro in Miami; Brendan Farrington in St. Marks, Florida; Russ Bynum in Keaton Beach, Florida; Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland, contributed to this story.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor the latest on Hurricane Michael, visit https://www.apnews.com/tag/Hurricanes\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Panama City\"","lat":8,"lng":-79,"__v":0}

The agreement allows ICE to house immigrant detainees at the county's Kearny jail.\\n\\nThursday's meeting ran for four and a half hours as dozens of speakers sounded off on ICE, immigration and President Trump.\\n\\nThis vote was an attempt by the county's Democratic leadership to placate activists and immigrant advocates who were angered by the July re-authorization. Judging by the comments of some of those activists on Thursday, the anger of anti-ICE activists has not diminished. They branded the freeholders \\\"tepid liberals,\\\" scolded them for working with ICE in the Trump era and criticized the measure approved Thursday as one that \\\"falls short\\\" of the county's pledge to exit the contact.\\n\\nThe meeting also saw dramatic statements from former detainees at the Kearny jail. Speaking through translators, one said he was targeted and abused at the jail because he is gay, another said he was raped twice by other inmates and jail officials did not investigate.\\n\\n\\\"We are not criminals. We are humans that deserve respect,\\\" said one of them, Edwin Perez.\\n\\nThe board voted 6-3 to approve the new version of the contract. Board members Ken Kopacz, Jerry Walker, Anthony Romano, Caridad Rodriguez and Albert Cifelli joined the board's chair, Anthony Vainieri, in favor. Bill O'Dea, Joel Torres and Tilo Rivas voted no.\\n\\nWhen the county renewed the contract in July, Hudson County Executive Tom DeGise initially defended it amid criticism from local activists. In September, he bowed to pressure by announcing a \\\"path to exit\\\" the contract. On Thursday, his critics said he has not followed through on that pledge.\\n\\n\\\"I can't even stress to everybody that's here tonight the empty promises that we have received from this freeholder board,\\\" said Kristen Beatty, co-­chair of Hudson County's branch of the North New Jersey Democratic Socialists of America. \\\"It's very discouraging.\\\"\\n\\nVainieri told The Jersey Journal that county officials continue discussions on how to end its ICE relationship early.\\n\\nThe conversation wasn't entirely anti-ICE. A few county residents argued that the county should not end the ICE contract early, including one corrections officer who said the immigrant detainees fear being moved far away if the contract is severed.\\n\\n\\\"I know they don't want to go to Alabama,\\\" said Lt. Rene Felix. \\\"They don't want to go to El Paso, they don't want to go to Louisiana. They want to stay here.\\\"\\n\\nJersey City woman Yvonne Balcer noted that terminating the contract could hurt residents' bottom line. The county expects to receive $19 million this year from ICE, which pays the county $120 daily per detainee.\\n\\n\\\"Your job is to represent the taxpayers of Hudson County,\\\" Balcer said. \\\"If you don't start putting us first we will start electing people who will put us first.\\\"\\n\\nThe freeholders, expecting a big crowd, moved the meeting from their chambers in the county's Pavonia Avenue administration annex to the administration building/courthouse across the street on Newark Avenue, where a fourth-floor jury room can accommodate about 400 people.\\n\\nSheriff's officers working as security barred anyone from taking photographs or videos during the meeting. One officer briefly confiscated a phone from a citizen who was using it to record the meeting.\\n\\nUndersheriff Andrew Conti, speaking to The Jersey Journal, cited Superior Court Assignment Judge Peter Bariso's standard policy against photographing and filming court proceedings without prior permission. Vainieri said the freeholders did not approve of the recording ban.\\n\\nTess Borden, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, spent the first few hours of the meeting trying to convince county officials and law enforcement that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution allows citizens to film public meetings. Borden filed an oral motion to open up the meeting to recording, a motion that Bariso denied, citing security reasons.\\n\\nThe size of the crowd on Thursday varied but did not exceed about 130 people.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Jersey City, New Jersey\"","lat":40,"lng":-74,"__v":0}

Facebook Marketplace and smartphone apps like Offer Up and Let Go are now the go-to dumping sites for those products.\\n\\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, the top stolen items nationwide include: designer clothing, denim pants, razors, infant formula, designer handbags, laundry detergent, cigarettes, high-end liquor, jewelry and teeth whitening strips.\\n\\nIn Albuquerque, electronics and power tools are especially popular targets, according to APD.\\n\\nShoplifting cases are usually committed by repeat offenders. For example, 26-year-old Cathy Hildebrand is what investigators in APD's Organized Crime Unit call an \\\"alert offender.\\\"\\n\\nShe has been in and out of jail at least 15 times in the past five years, according to police records.\\n\\nJust last month, police say surveillance video captured Hildebrand and an accomplice at a Home Depot stealing power drills.\\n\\nHildebrand would sell stolen items online using the app called Offer Up, according to police. She has posted at least 50 items for sale on the app - mostly power tools - selling them off for about $10,000, according to a review of her Offer Up account.\\n\\nHildebrand currently remains locked up in the Metropolitan Detention Center as she faces charges that include shoplifting, failure to appear for court in a previous case and failure to comply with conditions of release.\\n\\n\\\"If you look at our arrest warrants, it's the same people throughout the year.

Trevena ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.\\n\\nIn recent interviews, both Jones and Trevena talked about the changes they would make if elected on Nov. 6 to head the Camden Sheriff's Office and its $1.7 million annual budget.\\n\\nJones said he intends to revamp the internal structure of the sheriff's office if he's elected.\\n\\n\\\"No. 1, I'm going to insert a strict chain of command with experience and qualified supervisors,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdditionally, he plans to impose a system of employee evaluations, which he said would assist him in awarding merit-based pay raises and promotions.\\n\\nJones also plans to upgrade the citizen complaint process -- something he says would help ensure transparency. He said anyone who makes a formal complaint against a sheriff's employee will be notified about the progress of the probe and whether action is taken against the employee.\\n\\nJones also says he'll be a \\\"working sheriff.\\\" He plans to wear a sheriff's uniform and get out in the field. He said his intention is not to look over deputies' shoulders, but to motivate them to see themselves and him as part of a larger team.\\n\\nIf he's elected, Trevena said he plans to conduct a complete assessment of the sheriff's office and its personnel policies. However, he said his main focus will be on creating a \\\"civic-minded division\\\" within the department that \\\"focuses on programs that directly benefit our citizens.\\\"\\n\\nThat new division will focus on initiatives for youths and seniors he plans to launch. It also will host and sponsor monthly events for those groups.\\n\\nRegarding seniors, Trevena said he plans to launch a \\\"civility and wellness\\\" program allowing the sheriff's office to connect with them directly. He envisions the program providing seniors rides to the Camden Senior Center, for example.\\n\\nHe said he's currently involved in a Life Enrichment Program through the Norfolk Sheriff's Office that has law enforcement officers working with struggling students. If he's elected, he would bring a similar program to Camden, he said.\\n\\n\\\"I mean, we're public servants,\\\" Trevena said. \\\"We should be serving the public in every way possible.\\\"\\n\\nIn North Carolina, sheriffs can hire and fire employees at will. Both Jones and Trevena made clear they have no plans for any wholesale shakeup to sheriff's office personnel if they're elected.\\n\\nJones said he already knows many of the deputies and their abilities, so he doesn't foresee many issues as far as performance. At the same time, however, he would consider terminations if an employee wasn't performing up to standards even after remediation, mentoring and counseling sessions.\\n\\n\\\"We're going to have to take baby steps and it's going to be a while while I'm sitting down at the desk and getting everybody up to speed on the reorganization and how we're going to do it,\\\" he said.\\n\\nIf he's elected sheriff, Trevena said employees' conduct, demeanor and productivity will be fully evaluated. \\\"And from there we'll make a decision whether or not Camden County is the correct fit for them,\\\" he said.\\n\\nTrevena said he anticipates most current employees are doing a great job and are interested in continuing to serve Camden's citizens. At the same time, he, too, would be willing to part ways with employees who are not interested in serving with him or who have past performance or disciplinary issues.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, in the first 30 days, I'd like to identify who's interested in serving the Camden citizens and the visions that they've elected,\\\" he said. \\\"And then after we've identified who's interested in serving those visions and serving the residents, we'll be able to establish the personnel.\\\"\\n\\nBoth candidates commented on what they see as the top law enforcement problem in Camden, and what can be done to address it.\\n\\nJones said property crimes such as breaking and entering and larceny are the biggest law enforcement concern. He believes the crimes are largely tied to illegal drug abuse, as addicts steal and sell property to support their habits. Some of the crime is also connected to crime rings who case homes and break in when residents are away.\\n\\nIf he's elected, Jones said he would change the Camden Sheriff's Office's concentration on traffic enforcement on U.S. Highway 17. He said he would instead have deputies concentrate their effort in the county's residential communities to ensure quick response times.\\n\\nTrevena also cited illegal drug use as a major cause of crime in Camden. However, he doesn't think the county is any different from other communities when it comes to the ongoing opioid epidemic.\\n\\nTrevena said he believes drug dealers use U.S. Highway 17 and U.S. Highway 158 as transportation routes through Camden to get to Elizabeth City and Pasquotank County. From there, illegal drugs are distributed in Camden and other communities.\\n\\nTrevena said he would seek a grant to set up an anti-narcotics task force to focus on countering both drug trafficking and distribution. He also would ensure deputies are trained to recognize opioid abuse and to carry and administer Narcan to reverse the symptoms of an opioid overdose.\\n\\nAsked about the opioid crisis, Jones said he would have an open-door policy for opioid addicts to speak to him or any member of his staff without fear of arrest. He said the sheriff's office in turn can provide resources to get addicts get help.\\n\\n\\\"If we do that, we develop a rapport and trust with these people,\\\" he said.\\n\\nBoth candidates agree school safety will be a top priority if they're elected.\\n\\nTrevena said school safety in fact ranks first among his campaign priorities. If elected, he plans to lobby state lawmakers for funding to put school resource officers at all Camden schools.\\n\\nCurrently, the Camden Sheriff's Office has an SRO at Camden High School and Camden Early College. The department also has a second SRO who splits their time between Camden Middle School and Camden Intermediate School/Grandy Primary School.\\n\\nTrevena said that's not acceptable. If he's elected, he wants a satellite sheriff's office on one Camden school campus. An SRO would work at that school, he said.\\n\\n\\\"I will go so far as to travel to Raleigh myself and insist that they emergency-fund that,\\\" he said. \\\"I will go so far as to tell them that if something were to happen in one of our schools that they'll have blood on their hands.\\\"\\n\\nJones said if he's elected, he'll push for hiring a third school resource officer so there at least would be one SRO at all three campuses.\\n\\n\\\"That way, we've got coverage throughout the county all the time while school is in session,\\\" he said.\\n\\nJones also plans to have deputies on the day shift maintain a high-visibility presence around school campuses when school is in session. He also would have deputies visit schools and conduct periodic walk-throughs.\\n\\nBoth candidates cite their experience as assets.\\n\\nJones began his career in law enforcement by serving four years as a police officer in Elizabeth City. He has worked for the Highway Patrol for 24 years and says he's currently semi-retired. He said Oct. 31 will be his last day with the agency.\\n\\nHe said he can't begin to count how many hours he has spent on the witness stand testifying in different types of court cases.\\n\\n\\\"As a new sheriff coming in, I'm not one that is lacking in any particular area,\\\" he said. \\\"And I think that's an asset when I'm coming in and expected to be a leader.\\\"\\n\\nTrevena cites his experience as a Norfolk deputy for 25 years and his work with an agency that has a large annual budget.\\n\\n\\\"I'm also young and I'm energetic. I care about the citizens of Camden County,\\\" he said.\\n\\nTrevena said in Virginia, it's standard procedure for law enforcement to work hand in hand with civic-based programs.\\n\\n\\\"We need to serve the public in every way possible so that they're getting their money's worth,\\\" he said.\\n\\nPast political offices/campaigns: Won May 8 Republican primary for Camden sheriff.\\n\\nCivic/community affiliations: Member, N.C.

But for many Salvadoran Roman Catholic devotees who already know him as \\\"Saint Romero of the Americas\\\" that will only formalize something they have long known in their hearts.\\n\\n\\\"He was a great man. He already was a saint,\\\" said Jose David Santos, 73, in a recent interview before traveling to Rome along with 5,000 other Salvadorans to be present for the canonization.\\n\\n\\\"He was a great example of humility,\\\" Santos added, clad in a white shirt with Romero's face imprinted on it. \\\"He professed love for the poor man. He denounced injustices. He defended victims. He criticized the violence of the military and of the guerrillas.\\\"\\n\\nRomero was slain March 24, 1980, a day after he implored the military dictatorship to \\\"cease the repression\\\" against civilians as the country spiraled toward a 12-year civil war.\\n\\nAt the time -- and still today -- some in conservative sectors loathed him as a \\\"guerrilla in a cassock\\\" for sympathizing with leftist causes. But he was and remains broadly popular among the poor and working class, whom he passionately defended, and many began lionizing him almost immediately.\\n\\n\\\"A real man of the people. ... And so even prior to his canonization, even shortly after his martyrdom, we see this almost kind of folk-saint, popular-saint devotion springing up,\\\" said Andrew Chesnut, chair in Catholic studies at Virginia Commonwealth University.\\n\\n\\\"I've found a number of people that have tattoos of his image on their arms ... a lot of popular murals and artwork on the streets of the capital,\\\" Chesnut continued. \\\"So yeah, it's a real, genuine kind of grass-roots, working-class, popular devotion that you don't often see with a lot of other, European-born Catholic saints.\\\"\\n\\nThe fervor for Romero has grown so much that the cathedral crypt where his remains were interred can barely handle the thousands of pilgrims who arrive to pray in front of his tomb, beseech him for intervention or give thanks. Many also visit the hospital chapel where he was murdered while celebrating Mass.\\n\\nMaria Isabel de Hilario never met Romero but is convinced that in 1981, the year after his assassination, he visited her on her sickbed.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't know who he was, and he came to my bed at the hospital. He put his hand on my head and told me: 'It will no longer be necessary for you to be here. You will be healed,\\\" de Hilario said, weeping, in front of the tomb. \\\"We come every Sunday to visit him.\\\"\\n\\nNo place is more of a shrine to Romero than the Chacon family home in San Salvador. It was here that Romero sought refuge, watching TV and dining with the family to forget, even if briefly, the death threats that were mounting daily.\\n\\n\\\"He would sit next to my father to watch soap operas and tell jokes, while they prepared his beans for him. He said that this was his family. He said this home was his Bethany, that he felt so happy that he had an urge to take off his shoes,\\\" said Leonor Chacon, 80.\\n\\nChacon maintains a collection of Romero memorabilia -- his cassock, a shirt, a postcard he sent the family from Mexico City's Torre Latinoamericana, at that time the tallest skyscraper in the Americas -- and hundreds have come to the home to hear her. On a recent day she showed a photo of him taken in March 1980, days before his death.\\n\\n\\\"He knew that they were going to kill him. He told us, just like that. But he didn't want to talk about it,\\\" said Chacon, who first met Romero in 1963 when he officiated her wedding.\\n\\nRomero's assassin was contracted by right-wing death squads, but none of those who ordered the killing were ever punished in part due to an amnesty for civil war-era crimes that was ruled unconstitutional two years ago.\\n\\nMany years after Romero's death, Pope Francis declared him a martyr killed because of \\\"hatred of the faith,\\\" paving the way for his beatification and then canonization.\\n\\n\\\"It is the greatest thing we can have, it is the greatest blessing from heaven, the whole world acknowledging his sainthood,\\\" current San Salvador Archbishop Jose Luis Escobar Alas said. \\\"Because not only his person but his teachings as well are being canonized.\\\"\\n\\nOften said to have been influenced by the leftist Liberation Theology movement sweeping through the Latin American church at the time, Romero famously urged soldiers to disobey immoral commands and even asked President Jimmy Carter to cut off U.S. aid to El Salvador.\\n\\nTaking such a bold stance against the dictatorship, Chesnut said, was essentially \\\"signing his death warrant.\\\"\\n\\nEl Salvador's civil war ended with peace accords in 1992. But the country is now plagued by hyper-violent street gangs, and Chesnut said many Salvadorans turn to Romero for solace from that.\\n\\n\\\"It's still one of the most murderous countries on Earth. ... Few people have suffered like Salvadorans have in the last few decades,\\\" he said.\\n\\nEsteban Fuentes, a 55-year-old who has been driving a cab for 35 years in the Salvadoran capital and has a weathered card with an image of Romero hanging from his rear-view mirror, agreed.\\n\\n\\\"He has protected me from so much evil,\\\" Fuentes said. \\\"I started working in the middle of the war, and I came out alive. I believe that Romero kept me alive and continues to watch over me in these times of great problems.\\\"\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T06:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"San Salvador\"","lat":13,"lng":-89,"__v":0}

And the outcomes in these districts, from the nut and citrus orchards of the Central Valley to the increasingly diverse suburbs of Orange County, could decide which party controls the House.\\n\\n\\\"This year will be a real test of the appeal of new candidates,\\\" said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College and a former Republican strategist, who said it's unusual to see so many green candidates on the ballot in the most crucial races.\\n\\nMore first-time candidates are taking the plunge around the country this year, but California stands out. According to a Bay Area News Group analysis, 25 of the Democratic nominees in the most competitive 61 GOP-held House seats outside of California are first-timers, compared with nine of the 10 Democrats in the Golden State's marquee races. (Central Valley candidate TJ Cox previously ran for Congress and lost in 2006.)\\n\\nMost of the political newbies, who include a former national security aide who worked in Iraq, a law professor who studied under Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and a venture capital investor who helped fund Blue Apron, cite President Trump's victory as the wake-up call that inspired them to run.\\n\\n\\\"I had never aspired to be a politician,\\\" Cisneros said after a campaign event in a volunteer's backyard last month. But while he's less polished on the stump than his GOP opponent, former Assemblywoman Young Kim, \\\"it's not like I'm just walking in off the street,\\\" he argued, citing his military service, philanthropy work and role on an Obama administration arts commission.\\n\\nMany of California's in-play districts have been Republican turf for years, so there wasn't a large bench of Democratic officials waiting in the wings to run for Congress. In addition, new rules passed in 2012 easing limits on how long legislators can stay in their job reduced the incentive for some members of the Assembly and Senate to try swapping Sacramento for D.C.\\n\\nThe first-time candidates all survived hard-fought primaries, in several cases defeating local elected officials and politicians who had run in the districts previously. That's helped them grow into their roles, Sdao and other observers said.\\n\\n\\\"I think that being a bit naïve is good, because you may not fully appreciate all the challenges -- you march right through them,\\\" said Harley Rouda, a businessman and former Republican who's running against Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in a coastal Orange County district that catches some of the best surfing waves in the country. The state Democratic Party endorsed one of his primary rivals, and he got on the ballot by the barest of margins only after a vote-counting process that stretched on for two weeks and five days.\\n\\nRouda and the other new Democrats -- running at a time when voters are increasingly fed up with Washington -- come without the voting records and other political baggage of their GOP opponents. As she went door-to-door in a tranquil Irvine neighborhood on a recent Saturday, walking by plug-in electric cars and front lawn cacti, law professor Katie Porter made sure to tell every voter that her opponent, Rep. Mimi Walters, \\\"voted 99 percent of the time with Donald Trump.\\\"\\n\\nThe troupe of first-time candidates also argue they're less beholden to the state's Democratic establishment than they would be if they had worked their way up through the party machinery or spent years in Sacramento. That's made it easier for some of them to differentiate themselves with stances like opposing California's recent gas tax hike, which was championed by Gov. Jerry Brown, or calling for new leadership to replace House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nStill, their lack of an electoral history gives Republicans a better opportunity to define them in voters' minds than if they were experienced officials with more established name recognition.\\n\\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan, has spent millions of dollars bashing them with attack ads, labeling Los Angeles County Democrat Katie Hill \\\"immature,\\\" painting the Central Valley's Josh Harder as a \\\"Bay Area liberal,\\\" and, most damagingly, shining light on sexual harassment allegations against Cisneros. (The woman who accused Cisneros of harassment has since recanted, calling her accusation a \\\"huge misunderstanding.\\\")\\n\\nThe PAC \\\"went on air early to define first-time California candidates and put them on defense,\\\" said Courtney Alexander, a spokeswoman for the group. \\\"We have been able to set the terms of each race, and Democratic candidates have been forced to spend their money early in order to respond to our ads.\\\"\\n\\nSeveral of the new candidates have also been bruised by gaffes that more experienced campaigners might have avoided -- like when Harder was caught on video agreeing to support taxpayer-funded abortion through the \\\"full nine terms.\\\" He later said he misunderstood the question and supports current law allowing women to get an abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.\\n\\nMoreover, polls have found that in the Trump era, Golden State voters do value elected experience. Sixty-two percent of likely voters in a Public Policy Institute of California survey in February preferred a statewide candidate to have previously served in elected office, while just 31 percent said it was more important to have experience running a business.\\n\\nBut so far, the political novices are holding their own. They've outraised their Republican opponents in almost every district, some raking in record-breaking sums or spending millions on their own campaigns. And recent polls have shown tied races or Democrats ahead in a half-dozen districts.\\n\\nThey're also rejecting some traditional norms of how to run for office. Porter, for example, makes a point of bringing her three kids to campaign events. When she goes door-to-door canvassing, her 12-year-old son Luke helps enter voters' information into the campaign app, while her 6-year-old daughter Betsy runs ahead to knock on the next door.\\n\\nFor female candidates, \\\"there's historically been a school of thought that you should never mention your children and they should never be seen on the campaign trail, or it invites questions about how you're balancing work and family,\\\" Porter said. \\\"I think it's best to show people how you're doing it... and my kids have enjoyed it way more than I expected.\\\"\\n\\nAt a crowded office opening party for Hill -- whose district includes Ronald Reagan's grave -- volunteers argued that the 30-year-old nonprofit executive didn't need elected experience. Judy Mayer, a Simi Valley retiree, said Hill's personal experiences, like dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical debt and an unplanned pregnancy, were more important. \\\"She's not a typical politician,\\\" Mayer said.\\n\\nAll of the first-time candidates are learning just how unpredictable the campaign trail can be. On a recent Saturday afternoon, Democrat Mike Levin set off up Highway 1 to knock on voters' doors in his Orange and San Diego County district, with a volunteer driving and a reporter in the backseat. But the group was stymied when they got to the locked entrance of the exclusive Niguel Shores gated community.\\n\\nWhen another car pulled up, Levin and company swerved to tailgate in behind it. It didn't work: The access bar fell down, smacking the top of their car, and spikes shot up from the entranceway, slicing through the vehicle's back tires.\\n\\n\\\"Oh my God,\\\" Levin exclaimed.\\n\\nThe car slid to a halt on a manicured block looking out over the Pacific -- just across the street from a house with a bright blue Mike Levin yard sign out front. Its owners, Hal and Mary Schaffer, were delighted to see the candidate knocking at their gate, and helped him and his team arrange a tow.\\n\\n\\\"Anything can happen in a campaign,\\\" Levin said later, as he hustled to his next event. \\\"That's what makes it interesting.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T17:29:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Irvine, California\"","lat":33,"lng":-117,"__v":0}

United's versatile, selfless star\"","body":"\"WASHINGTON - If any singular moment has captured the essence of Paul Arriola's first full season with D.C. United, it was one that immediately followed a crucial 3-1 win over Atlanta on Sept. 2.\\n\\nLuciano Acosta scored a brace to lift D.C. to a crucial victory in their playoff chase. And having just finished his first MLS start as a right back, Arriola took yet another new role, on behalf of the FOX Sports sideline crew.\\n\\n\\\"They just asked me if I could translate,\\\" Arriola recalled. \\\"I was just kind of like, 'Oh, yeah, I'll go do it.'\\\"\\n\\nThought of primarily as a attack-minded winger prior to the season, Arriola has played a box-to-box midfield role this year, and on Sunday found himself at right back again in a 2-1 win over the Chicago Fire.\\n\\nBecause of a season-ending injury to Oniel Fisher, there's a strong chance Arriola will remain there when D.C. host FC Dallas at Audi Field on Saturday (4:55 pm ET | Univision - full TV \u0026 streaming info). It's a luxury most teams wouldn't expect from a player with Arriola's U.S. national team pedigree.\\n\\n\\\"You don't know how many players ... [are] not willing to embrace a new role or a moment in a selfless way,\\\" said D.C. coach Ben Olsen after the Atlanta match. \\\"He didn't even think about it. It was like, 'All right, let's go.'\\\"\\n\\nThis certainly wasn't the vision outlined when Arriola decided to sign and transfer from Liga MX side Club Tijuana in August 2017.\\n\\nWell before the addition of attackers Wayne Rooney, Yamil Asad and Darren Mattocks, Arriola viewed his move to D.C. as a chance to prove he could be a more productive winger on offense. The DP tag added some wanted pressure.\\n\\n\\\"You want to provide for the team,\\\" Arriola said. \\\"You want to give back and be the player that not only provides energy, but provides things that make differences in the game.\\\"\\n\\nBy statistical measures, he's succeeded, bagging 7 goals and 8 assists in a campaign made more complicated by D.C.'s varying positional needs.\\n\\n\\\"I've been very happy with myself, and I've been able to kind of do a lot of things,\\\" Arriola said. \\\"I didn't think that I would start out being a starting right back at the moment, and I didn't think I would be playing as a center midfielder at any time in the season.\\\"\\n\\nWhere his willingness to be versatile could complicate matters is on the international front.\\n\\nAfter playing his customary wide midfield position in the USMNT's 2-0 friendly loss to Brazil last month, Arriola talked with interim coach Dave Sarachan and decided to leave camp early to play for D.C. in a midweek game against Minnesota.\\n\\nHe doesn't believe that decision contributed to his omission from the team selected for October friendlies against Colombia and Peru. But he admits he left the Brazil game feeling slightly uncomfortable with his performance.\\n\\n\\\"There were certain things that I wasn't so used to anymore,\\\" Arriola said. \\\"I'd been playing center midfield for a while in a system that's very different, and then I started to play out wide here which is completely different than playing out wide for the national team.\\\"\\n\\nIronically, it was Arriola's desire to be a part of the youth national program a decade ago that first convinced him being flexible was a good thing.\\n\\nA forward growing up on the Southern California youth scene, coaches pushed him to transition to a wide midfielder and then an outside back as he climbed the regional structure towards the US youth national teams.\\n\\n\\\"I'm thinking, well, if I want to be on the national team, I'm going to do my best at this position,\\\" Arriola recalls. \\\"They're telling me this is where they see me. I'm not in charge here. I'm going to do my best to be on the team.\\\"\\n\\nArriola's assets may be harder to discern for those understandably mesmerized by the partnership Rooney and Acosta have forged.\\n\\nAcosta is making a strong case for award consideration with 9 goals and a team-leading 16 assists. Rooney has proven he has plenty left in the tank with 9 goals and 7 assists in 16 appearances. If that leaves Arriola as a third man of sorts, he insists he's cool with it.\\n\\n\\\"For me, if they talk about Lucho and Wayne, it's better,\\\" Arriola said. \\\"It takes pressure off the rest of the team, and these guys are playing great.\\n\\n\\\"When I'm playing great, it's awesome, and when people want to interview me and talk about me it's cool. But if they want to talk about Lucho and they want me to go in and translate for him, I have no problem with that.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T17:29:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington, D.C.\"","lat":38,"lng":-77,"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc0da4078ec025863eecfb5"},"title":"\"Ponzi scheme suspect cast spells, paid $720K for prayers to thwart charges\"","body":"\"GREENBELT, Md. -- An investment adviser charged with orchestrating a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme spent nearly three-quarters of a million dollars on prayers by Hindu priests in India to ward off a federal investigation and save her failing business, according to testimony at her trial this week.\\n\\nUsing investors' money, Dawn Bennett paid a man in Washington state approximately $720,000 between 2015 and 2017 to arrange for the priests to perform religious ceremonies meant to ease her troubles, said a Justice Department prosecutor and the man Bennett paid. For one of these \\\"yagya\\\" rituals, Bennett spent $7,250 for five priests to pray for her across 29 consecutive days.\\n\\n\\\"I am in a very very tough fight going against my enemies and I need all the help I can get,\\\" Bennett wrote in an email to Puja.net website operator Benjamin Collins.\\n\\nSix-figure payments for prayers didn't spare Bennett from a 17-count indictment on fraud charges. Neither did the \\\"hoodoo\\\" spells that investigators suspected her of casting to stymie federal investigators, a claim fueled by a peculiar discovery during an FBI search of her home.\\n\\nCollins, a government witness at Bennett's trial, testified on Tuesday that he sincerely believed the religious rituals would help Bennett, whose payments accounted for roughly half of his website's income.\\n\\n\\\"We don't necessarily pray with a guaranteed outcome,\\\" he added.\\n\\nBennett, 56, raised more than $20 million from at least 46 investors in her luxury sportswear company, often preying on elderly clients who knew her from a radio show she hosted in the Washington, D.C., area, authorities have said. They said she used investors' money for her personal benefit, including jewelry purchases, cosmetic medical procedures and a $500,000 annual lease for a luxury suite at the Dallas Cowboys' home stadium.\\n\\nBennett told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis on Thursday that she doesn't intend to testify at her trial. One of her trial lawyers, Dennis Boyle, said Bennett invested $13 million of her own money into the fledgling apparel business, selling assets and mortgaging homes to generate cash.\\n\\n\\\"She clearly believes that this is a legitimate company,\\\" he said. \\\"It catered to only the most discerning people.\\\"\\n\\nBut her apparel business, DJBennett, never made a profit and had at least $15.6 million in liabilities and only $550,000 in revenue by December 2016, according to a complaint filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\nThe indictment says she also used money from some investors to pay others, but many lost everything they paid Bennett.\\n\\nJoan Barney, a retired travel agent whose husband has Parkinson's disease and dementia, said she invested a total of $200,000 in Bennett's business. Barney testified Wednesday that she had known Bennett for more than 25 years and believed her promise that she could get her money back, plus 15 percent interest, whenever she needed it. She said Bennett sent her a business plan that purportedly showed the company was profitable.\\n\\n\\\"I trusted Dawn,\\\" said Barney, who added that Bennett \\\"knew that this was the only money that I had to care for my husband and his illness.\\\"\\n\\nBarney received a $37,500 return on her investment but lost the rest. Another investor, Diane Keefe, fought back tears when she testified that she hasn't recovered any of the $816,805 she paid Bennett.\\n\\nKeefe said Bennett had told her the online apparel company was thriving.\\n\\n\\\"And I believed her,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe FBI's investigation of Bennett began in December 2015 after the SEC formally accused her of defrauding investors by inflating the amount of assets she managed and exaggerating the returns on her customers' investments. The SEC cited statements that Bennett made on her paid weekly radio show, \\\"Financial Myth Busting With Dawn Bennett.\\\"\\n\\nBennett's financial advisory business was losing clients and incurring millions of dollars in losses before she turned to the fraudulent sale of promissory notes to \\\"tap a new income stream,\\\" the SEC said in its complaint.\\n\\n\\\"As her financial condition rapidly deteriorated, Bennett began accumulating a variety of personal financial obligations, but nonetheless continued to spend considerable sums to fund her extravagant lifestyle,\\\" the complaint said.\\n\\nWhen FBI agents searched Bennett's home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last year, they found instructions for placing people under a \\\"Beef Tongue Shut Up Hoodoo Spell\\\" and biographical information for at least three government attorneys working on the SEC investigation of Bennett, according to an agent's affidavit.\\n\\nFBI agents also found the initials of SEC attorneys written on the lids of Mason jars stored in Bennett's freezers, suggesting she had cast spells in hopes of \\\"paranormally silencing\\\" the SEC attorneys, the agent wrote.\\n\\nBennett's attorneys argued that any such \\\"hoodoo\\\" practices are irrelevant and their mention by prosecutors only serves to smear her. Boyle also objected to testimony about the \\\"substance\\\" of the prayers she commissioned in India.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that she prays to a different God or has a different faith shouldn't matter,\\\" he said.\\n\\nBennett's trial in Greenbelt started Oct. 2 and is expected to stretch into next week. Bennett initially was freed after her August 2017 arrest in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but a magistrate judge later ordered her detained for violating the terms of her pretrial release.\\n\\nBradley Mascho, who worked as the chief financial officer for one of Bennett's companies, was indicted on related charges. He pleaded guilty in June to conspiring to commit securities fraud and awaits a sentencing hearing.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T17:28:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Greenbelt, Maryland\"","lat":39,"lng":-76,"__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc0da4078ec025863eecfb6"},"title":"\"Manchin makes principled decision\"","body":"\"U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was the only Democrat to vote for Brett Kavanaugh to serve as a justice on the Supreme Court, so he may be taking some heat for \\\"switching sides\\\" during this divisive confirmation process.\\n\\nAs I no longer live or work for a newspaper in the Mountain State, thus my words won't be parsed by partisans, I can tell you what I know about Manchin and the West Virginia values that should be guiding the nation.\\n\\nWest Virginia is a small state where everyone gets to know everyone. As a member of the press corps, I interviewed Manchin on numerous occasions and spent a lot of time in his neck of the woods.\\n\\nManchin grew up in Farmington, a very small town that was the site of a mine disaster where his uncle was killed. Like much of West Virginia, Farmington is filled with kind people who will not hesitate to help a neighbor in need.\\n\\nThe trick to living in a small town, where independent-minded people share a variety of opinions, is to find common ground. The themes and values that unite a community, the bonds that people share, are more important than what divides folks. Moreover, if you create too many enemies in the hills n' hollers, when you need a helping hand while up the creek without a paddle, you better learn to swim.\\n\\nManchin has the common touch much like his uncle, A.J. Manchin, a popular and influential state leader who dominated Charleston politics until he died.\\n\\nDuring Manchin's time as governor, he led a bi-partisan effort to improve mine safety in the wake of the Sago mine disaster where 12 miners were killed. Time and time again, Manchin reached out across the aisle to pass state budgets and did much to improve the quality of education.\\n\\nManchin was elected to fill that vacancy left when Robert C. Byrd, the nation's longest serving U.S. Senator, died in 2010.\\n\\nManchin is frustrated that he is not as easily able to reach across the aisle to Republicans or even his fellow Democrats to pursue policies that would benefit the nation. Because of Manchin's willingness to pursue a moderate course, he has become a target of partisan political attacks from every angle. It's not easy being your own man in a country that may be more divided since the Civil War, certainly since Vietnam.\\n\\nFast forward to the present when Manchin votes for Kavanaugh. The Left and his own party are screeching at what they consider as betrayal. The Right and the GOP are skeptical and even cynical of Manchin's choice because they think his vote was motivated by his need to persuade voters to support his bid for re-election in a coal state that proudly supports President Trump.\\n\\nWhen Trump was in Wheeling recently for a nationally televised campaign rally held in support of Manchin's Republican opponent, he touted poll numbers favoring Kavanaugh's confirmation while condemning the man who was most likely to help him win that fight.\\n\\nEssentially, Manchin had a tough decision to make. If he supported Kavanaugh, he risked losing Democrats. However, if Manchin voted \\\"no\\\" then he would most certainly lose Republicans and independents. And certainly, a vote to confirm would alienate the Democratic leadership in the Senate.\\n\\nDamned if you do, damned if you don't, but that's the political calculus.\\n\\nUnlike senators from both parties who had their minds made up long before casting a vote, Manchin attended the confirmation hearings, studied the FBI report, spoke to Kavanaugh and listened to thousands of his constituents before making a principled decision to support the nominee.\\n\\n\\\"I have reservations about this vote given the serious accusations against Judge Kavanaugh and the temperament he displayed in the hearing,\\\" Manchin said in statement made Friday. \\\"And my heart goes out to anyone who has experienced any type of sexual assault in their life. However, based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him. I do hope that Judge Kavanaugh will not allow the partisan nature this process took to follow him onto the court.\\\"\\n\\nWhile there are many politicians prattling about proclaiming their support for principle in the face of overwhelming evidence, Manchin took a tough stand by doing his duty to serve not only West Virginia, but the nation.\\n\\nMuch like Tarheels, West Virginians value working together toward finding common ground, treating adversaries with respect and making independent decisions that are guided more by principle than politics -- ideals that are needed to guide our country more than ever.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T17:28:00.000Z"},"location":"\"United States\"","lat":39,"lng":-98,"__v":0}

(AP) Good luck trying to figure out what's going to happen when Oklahoma State visits Kansas State.\\n\\nBoth teams have been a mystery this season.\\n\\nThe Cowboys (4-2, 1-2) picked up a good non-conference win over Boise State, rapidly rose to No. 15 in the nation and had set their sights on competing for the Big 12 title. Then, they were throttled by Texas Tech, struggled against lowly Kansas and lost a week ago to Iowa State.\\n\\nThen there's the Wildcats (2-4, 0-3), who returned most of their key players from a team that won the Cactus Bowl last season. But beginning with a season-opening escape against South Dakota, the Wildcats have struggled to live up to expectations, their only win against a Football Bowl Subdivision opponent coming in their non-conference finale against UTSA.\\n\\n''Is there frustration? For sure, a lot of it,'' Kansas State offensive lineman Dalton Risner said. ''Is there a little bit of doubt sometimes? Yeah. A little bit of self-confidence, low self-confidence? Yeah, sometimes. But we're moving forward. We haven't taken any days off to where we're just feeling sorry for ourselves. I think that's really important.''\\n\\nIn fact, the Wildcats had a players-only meeting last week, a rarity for Bill Snyder's program. It lasted about 30 minutes and allowed the players to ''get some things off their chests,'' Risner said.\\n\\nNow, the question is whether it translates to improvement on the field.\\n\\n''If it's going to be productive, then I think it's appropriate,'' Snyder said. ''You've got to have a great deal of trust in your players to consent, to allow that to happen - although they have control over whether they get together or not. I think it went well from what I understand.''\\n\\nCowboys quarter Taylor Cornelius said no such meetings were needed in Stillwater.\\n\\n''It's always got to be positive. It's like any other week of preparation,'' he said. ''We're off of Iowa State and we're on to Kansas State, so it's just another week of preparation.''\\n\\nAnother opportunity to rebound from a loss, too.\\n\\n''We're ready to go. We want to bounce back and we know that anything is possible,'' Cowboys running back Chuba Hubbard said. ''It might've gotten off to a rough start, but we're going to finish strong.''\\n\\nCLOSE DOESN'T COUNT\\n\\nKansas State had a chance to score a go-ahead touchdown against Texas a couple weeks ago but couldn't move the ball in a 19-14 loss. The Wildcats also led Baylor in the fourth quarter a week ago before watching the Bears kick the winning field goal with 8 seconds left.\\n\\n''Playing well for three quarters is good,'' Snyder said, ''but doesn't get the job done.''\\n\\nPASS-IVE DEFENSE\\n\\nOklahoma State allowed third-string quarterback Brock Purdy to go 18 of 23 for 318 yards and four touchdowns in last week's loss to Iowa State. That would be encouraging for Kansas State if only the Wildcats had any semblance of a passing game.\\n\\n''They run their quarterback a lot,'' Oklahoma State linebacker Justin Phillips said. ''They have some big dudes up front that they utilize and tighten up a little bit. They just get behind their big guys and try to run the ball.''\\n\\nBEWARE THE BIG PLAY\\n\\nThe Cyclones managed to hit the Cowboys with several big plays, including five touchdowns of at least 20 yards.\\n\\n''Defensively, we can't give up the big plays. You have to try to defend the deep ball better,'' Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. ''Our guys are getting violated with our eyes, getting caught in the backfield and getting run by. We just have to tighten it down.''\\n\\nRUNNING BACK SHOWDOWN\\n\\nIn the pass-happy Big 12, good luck finding a better matchup of running backs than the Cowboys' Justice Hill and the Wildcats' Alex Barnes.

Allison Winterhalter's 35-foot shot late in the first half was the game's only score.\\n\\n\\\"Man, she played well tonight,\\\" Mason coach Adam Schur said. \\\"She was super good with her back to the goal. It was really just a good play by our whole team. Tori Bonno won the ball at midfield, then Nicole Onweller made a great play and Allison was so composed for the shot. It's what she's done all year.\\\"\\n\\nBoth teams came into the game unbeaten in league play and Fairfield had not lost all season. Mason's only loss was non-conference to Loveland of the Eastern Cincinnati Conference, 2-0 on Sept. 29. Loveland coach Todd Kelly was in attendance Thursday in anticipation of a postseason matchup with one of the teams (last fall Loveland defeated Fairfield 2-1 in regional action).\\n\\n\\\"I'm really proud of the girls,\\\" Schur said. \\\"We fought through a lot of adversity over the course of the last 12-18 months. I'm really happy for the moment that they get tonight. That's really what this is all about for us. It's been kind of fun the last two years to have the end game be the ultimate championship game. It's good prep for both teams heading into the tournament.\\\"\\n\\nFairfield played without last year's GMC-leading scorer Morgan White.

Loveland's only loss was 2-0 recently to MND so the scores are comparable.\\n\\nThrough four games in October, Mason's defense with Bethany Moser in goal is unscored upon. Schur would be delighted to see that continue into the postseason.\\n\\n\\\"Southwest Ohio's really strong this year,\\\" he said. \\\"Loveland, Fairfield, Anderson and there's a lot of good GGCL schools. I saw Beavercreek and Centerville and they're both really talented. We're going to enjoy this for a couple days and then focus on our first-round tournament opponent. Hopefully, we get to see some of those teams I've mentioned because that means we won a few games.\\\"\\n\\nStanding alertly beside Schur during his post-game interview is 2018 Mason grad, Bradley Tripp. Confined to a wheelchair, his enthusiasm is unconfined. He's a participant, coach and No. 1 fan and has even scored an exhibition goal at an FC Cincinnati game with the assist of his sister, Emily.\\n\\nA Magnum Cum Laude Comet and Principal's Award winner with Emily, Bradley was in Andrew Schur's Algebra class when the Mason coach recognized his love for soccer as an underclassman. Schur drew up a contract and Shipp has been on the sidelines for games ever since along with frequenting other soccer events. Coach Schnur respectfully refers to Bradley as Coach Shipp.\\n\\nCoach Shipp is often seen posing with the Mason girls and pretty much anyone who approaches and wants a photo. The smile is contagious along with the optimism.\\n\\n\\\"I'm always happy,\\\" Shipp said. \\\"They say expect the unexpected. We got the win. All glory to God, he's the one that made it happen, not all of us. We might end up in state. I hope we win state. That would be awesome! In all of my years in coaching and being the No. 1 fan I've never seen us win state before.\\\"\\n\\nSo, the pressure is on Schur and Mason. It's not on Shipp, who exited via his self-powered chair but posed for one more photo before leaving. It was Fairfield coach Patrick O'Leary. Even the losing team appreciates Shipp's perpetual glow and there's always the chance for a rematch.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:14:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Mason, Ohio\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"39.36006"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-84.30994"},"__v":0}

Even if a line is not charged at that moment, it could become live without warning. A common time for lines to be down would be during or after storms like we have recently experienced. Puddles or flowing water expand the area of danger, so be sure to stay well clear of them. Instead of stepping over them, go all the way around.\\n\\nIf power is out, intersections may be dark and the traffic control lights may not be working. If that is the case, approach the intersection with caution and treat it as if it was controlled by four way stop signs. It is not just a good safety procedure, it is the law!\\n\\nMany traffic accidents seem to occur during or just after a rain storm. Roadways are slick and you need more room to stop. So slow down and use extra caution. Visibility is also reduced. Have you inspected your windshield wipers lately? Heat and direct sunlight can quickly age your wipers. Old and worn wipers can make visibility worse instead of better.\\n\\nThe time to make our personal and family plans/preparations are BEFORE the emergency occurs.

In addition, the county courts provide public record, passport and other services.\\n\\nJudge William Cohen, the presiding judge in the court's Bennington unit, praised the courthouse staffs, saying they \\\"are incredibly good at what they do; they are patient, resilient. We can't do our job without having a competent staff who keep things organized and keep our dockets, and that is across the board in every division in this county.\\\"\\n\\nBut a significant challenge exists, he said, in that staff numbers and resources have been shrinking \\\"on all staffs,\\\" while there are \\\"high expectations on all of us as dockets are expanding.\\\"\\n\\nFor the past five years, Reiber said, the addiction crisis has spread negative effects throughout the court system.\\n\\n\\\"We noticed a substantial increase in criminal cases\\\" related to addiction, he said, \\\"and then it manifested itself in the family court docket. ... We have really struggled to keep up with all of the child protective cases coming in the door.\\\"\\n\\nThe impact has been significant on Family Court, Reiber said, centered on a surge of those cases, which he said involve children \\\"who are neglected more than anything else.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition, appeals in termination of parental rights cases \\\"have gone up dramatically,\\\" he said.\\n\\nDrug-related issues also affect the Probate Court, landlord-tenant and other dockets of the system, the officials said.\\n\\nThere also is an increased need for legal representation in Family Court, officials said, at the same time fewer young lawyers are working in that court unless they are doing pro bono work, because many clients have a limited ability to pay for representation.\\n\\nAttorney John Lamson, who worked for many years with Have Justice Will Travel, which provides free legal and related services, said he sees \\\"a huge gap in family law\\\" between those who have an attorney helping with their divorce or other family cases and those going into court without a lawyer.\\n\\nMany people fall within an income range where they don't qualify for free legal assistance and are reluctant to pay for an attorney, he said.\\n\\nBennington County State's Attorney Erica Marthage agreed, saying her husband, Brian Marthage, has a family law practice \\\"and there is a huge shortage.\\\"\\n\\nShe added, \\\"The big firms are not hiring family law specialists,\\\" leaving an inadequate number of lawyers in the area in private practice.\\n\\nThat discussion led to a focus on pro bono services and providing basic advice for residents seeking to represent themselves in an uncontested divorce or other situation.\\n\\nBennington County Probate Judge D. Justine Scanlon cited the \\\"inordinate amount of time\\\" spent by residents and those assisting them in filing out required forms. She advocated simplifying that process where possible, especially for those forms available online.\\n\\nScanlon and county Assistant Judge Wesley Mook said it also shouldn't be assumed that most Vermonters are computer literate and able to deal with online forms, or have access to a computer.\\n\\nAmong ideas were holding periodic legal clinics on topics such as the process of having an old conviction expunged from a person's record or how to weave through a court action while representing one's self or with limited assistance from an attorney.\\n\\nMany years ago, Scanlon said, there were \\\"People's Law School\\\" classes held in the Bennington area with information provided by local attorneys on various topics.\\n\\n\\\"I think it would be more effective in a clinic setting versus a lecture setting,\\\" said Sarah Wilson, president of the Bennington County Bar Association.\\n\\nIt was also suggested that recording attorneys or others discussing legal topics would be a more effective way to spread that information statewide, and a method of easily focusing on multiple issues.\\n\\nTherese Corsones, executive director of the Vermont Bar Association, said that topic currently is being explored with officials at Vermont Law School, with the hope of involving the students.\\n\\nLon McClintock, a past president of the local bar, said his experience as a select board member in Shaftsbury showed him the impact local cable access networks can have in spreading information via recorded programs.\\n\\n\\\"Once the content is produced, local access networks are always looking for meaningful content,\\\" he said.\\n\\nMook said the option of mediation should not be overlooked as a means of resolving disputes and lessening the burden on court dockets. Formal mediation services have \\\"kind of gone by the wayside [in recent years],\\\" he said.\\n\\nOn the subject of pro bono work by local attorneys, Corsones said the state bar is establishing a program for retired lawyers willing to participate that could provide malpractice insurance coverage.\\n\\nWilson said the local bar also is beginning an initiative for retired lawyers who want to do pro bono work.\\n\\nAlso attending the session were Laurie Canty, Regional Superior Court clerk for Addison, Bennington and Rutland court units; former Bennington Unit Presiding Judge David Howard, who retired in March; and Superior Court Judges John Valente and David Barra.\\n\\nAnyone who wishes to comment on aspects of the courts or legal system should contact Corsones at the Vermont Bar Association.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:11:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Bennington, Vermont\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"42.87813"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-73.19677"},"__v":0}

Core net income per share (diluted) for the first nine months of 2018 increased by 30% over the same period in 2017.\\n\\nGrowth in the first nine months of 2018 was generally satisfactory, as deposits increased to $1.715 billion at September 30, 2018, representing 19% annualized growth year-to-date and 18% growth from September 30, 2017. This growth reflected modest growth in retail and business deposits as well as the increasing use of more attractively priced wholesale deposits in lieu of comparable Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

Total assets increased to $2.370 billion, representing 5% annualized growth year-to-date and 7% growth from September 30, 2017. During the first nine months of 2018, the Bank used a portion of its cash balances to reduce outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances and listing services time deposits, in order to minimize the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity. Book value per share was $98.35 as of September 30, 2018, representing 17% annualized growth year-to-date and 17% growth from September 30, 2017. In addition to the increase in book value per share, the Bank declared $1.73 in dividends per share since September 30, 2017, including a special dividend of $0.34 per share declared during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Bank announced increases in its regular quarterly dividend in both June and September 2018.\\n\\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the third quarter of 2018. At September 30, 2018, non-performing assets totaled 0.02% of total assets, compared to 0.07% at December 31, 2017 and 0.05% at September 30, 2017. Non-performing loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio totaled 0.02% at September 30, 2018, compared to 0.09% at December 31, 2017 and 0.06% at September 30, 2017.

The efficiency ratio was 29.17% for the third quarter of 2018, as compared to 29.37% for the same period last year. Non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets fell to 0.86% in the third quarter of 2018, as compared to 0.90% for the same period last year.\\n\\nChairman Robert H. Gaughen, Jr. stated, \\\"We are pleased to report that returns on equity and assets remained satisfactory in the third quarter of 2018, although balance sheet growth was modest relative to capital generation. We remain focused on careful capital allocation, defensive underwriting and disciplined cost control - we believe these are the keys to generating sustained value for our ownership.\\\"\\n\\nHingham Institution for Savings is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank located in Hingham, Massachusetts.

The new policy aims to increase options for housing in response to growing demand, promote sustainable development, encourage innovation and creative design solutions, and minimize potential traffic resulting from increased density. The pilot program is an important component of Mayor Martin J. Walsh's updated Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030, which responds to Boston's population growth by increasing the city's overall housing goals to 69,000 new units by the year 2030.\\n\\n\\\"In response to greater demand for efficient and transit-oriented housing, we have seen an increased number of proposals for smaller residential units,\\\" said Director of the BPDA, Brian Golden. \\\"These guidelines will allow us to work with the community to ensure that these new projects best serve residents and neighborhoods.\\\"\\n\\nThe Compact Living Policy, spearheaded by the Mayor's Housing Innovation Lab (Mayor's iLab), follows a citywide tour of a 385 square foot model compact unit. The feedback received from over 2,000 community members who visited the unit were incorporated into the final guidelines. The Compact Living Guidelines address unit design, shared spaces, and measures to reduce transportation costs and impacts. All projects which fall under the Compact Living Guidelines must go through the BPDA's Article 80 public review process. To learn more about the requirements and tour a model unit, watch this video: https://youtu.be/YsOFhxzLpjg.\\n\\n\\\"Creating affordable housing solutions for Bostonians requires flexibility in housing styles,\\\" said Department of Neighborhood Development Chief of Housing, Sheila Dillon. \\\"Compact living is an innovation in Boston that we want to see happening in the right way to create flexibility that works for everybody. This new policy provides that framework, and I'm very pleased with the work done by the Mayor's iLab to get us here.\\\"\\n\\nThe design standards outlined in the Compact Living Policy are meant to minimize personal space without reducing livability, and foster resident community through thoughtfully designed interior and exterior shared spaces. Unit interior guidelines prioritize function, storage, and natural light. Shared spaces should foster interaction, provide functional space that would otherwise be located inside a traditional unit, be located on a common path of travel, and be properly managed and maintained.\\n\\n\\\"As units get smaller, good design and natural light become so important,\\\" said Tamara Roy, Principal at Stantec Architecture. \\\"I'm happy to see these guidelines focus on high quality spaces and shared common areas.\\\"\\n\\nThe pilot program will require developments utilizing the guidelines to systematically adopt Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies, in line with the goals outlined in Go Boston 2030 and Imagine Boston 2030. TDM improves mobility and access for residents and reduces congestion by using a formula to ensure that these developments are incorporating strategies to minimize car use, enhance bicycle use, and encourage the use of public transportation.\\n\\n\\\"By increasing pedestrian amenities, building a system of strategically located protected bike lanes, and working with the MBTA to implement measures to improve services for Boston residents, such as designated bus lanes, the City of Boston is actively working to encourage more people to walk, ride bikes and take public transit to move around the City,\\\" said Boston Transportation Commissioner Gina N. Fiandaca. \\\"Linking the Compact Living initiative directly to the mobility goals outlined in Go Boston 2030 and Imagine Boston 2030 will strongly support these ongoing transportation efforts and work to decrease traffic congestion and improve safety for all users of Boston's roadways.\\\"\\n\\nThe City of Boston has seen an increase in demand for smaller units and both BPDA and the Inspectional Services Department (ISD) have seen an increase in the number of development applications proposing smaller units. The Compact Living Design Guidelines are intended to provide guidance to the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) when they consider projects proposing smaller units. Throughout the two year pilot program, the guidelines will be reviewed to ensure they are helping to meet the goals of the program.\\n\\nThe Compact Living Policy applies to new developments of ten units or more. All developments must comply of the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP).

With this increase, state-subsidized early education and care providers have received rate increases worth nearly $100 million during the past four years.\\n\\nThe Board of Early Education and Care voted this afternoon to approve a 4.58 percent increase that will support teacher salaries, benefits, and professional development at center-based early education and care programs and family child care systems that enroll children funded by the Department of Early Education and Care (EEC), in order to improve educator hiring and retention.\\n\\nThe new rate increase is on top of the 8 percent increase for state-subsidized early education and care providers in FY 2018, which was the largest rate hike in more than a decade. The funding for the 4.58 percent increase to the daily reimbursement rate was made possible through an appropriation in the fiscal year 2019 state budget. The daily reimbursement rate for state-subsidized center-based child care programs and family child care system administrators will increase for all age groups and regions of the state, and will be retroactive to July 1, 2018.\\n\\n\\\"We are extremely proud of our work with the Legislatures over the past few years to provide historic rate increases to early education providers that will benefit thousands of young children,\\\" said Governor Charlie Baker. \\\"The investments we've worked together to provide will enhance learning environments and help early education and care programs improve their quality through professional development and retention efforts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We are pleased to have worked with our colleagues in the Legislature to provide this significant rate increase, so that our early education and care providers will be able to ensure they can retain highly-qualified teachers that help our youngest learners grow and be ready for school,\\\" said Lt. Governor Karyn Polito.\\n\\n\\\"Early education and care is a priority for the House, and this year we spearheaded another $20 million increase to support our dedicated early education workforce, as well as initiatives to increase quality programs and expand support for early childhood mental health efforts,\\\" said House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo. \\\"This investment will help to build stronger families, support safe and nurturing environments for young children and prepare them for success in the classroom and beyond.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One of the most important investments we can make as a Commonwealth is in our youngest children and their caregivers. Early educators and child care providers do the important work of setting our youngest children up for resiliency and success, and we must support them in doing so,\\\" Senate President Karen Spilka said. \\\"The Senate has long prioritized investing in quality education for everyone, from birth through adulthood, and so I am pleased to see these increases come through.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This additional increase builds on the historic investment in our early educators, which will help stabilize the workforce, ensure programs can pay good teachers more, and build on other quality initiatives,\\\" Education Secretary James Peyser said.\\n\\n\\\"This rate increase will enhance the capacity of programs that care for some of the highest needs children in the Commonwealth by providing quality environments and settings that foster children's learning and healthy development,\\\" said Early Education and Care Commissioner Tom Weber.\\n\\nThe rate increase passed today supports progress toward EEC's goal to have the subsidized rate in all regions of the state be comparable to at least 75 percent of the local private market rate for the same type of care. EEC is also committed to ensuring continued access to child care subsidies during FY 2019. Currently, EEC subsidizes the enrollment of approximately 55,000 children each day in high-quality early education and care programs across the state. EEC's subsidies allow families who are low-income or in-need of assistance to access high-quality care at minimal or no-cost to them.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:10:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Boston\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"42.35843"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-71.05977"},"__v":0}

Pair of $4M winners sold this week say so\"","body":"\"MACOMB, MI -- With nearly $900 million in lottery jackpots up for grabs this weekend, lottery players across Michigan may want to head out to Macomb to pick up their tickets for the Mega Millions and Powerball drawings.\\n\\nSilver House Liquor in Macomb is the luckiest lotto retailer in the state right now as it has sold not one, but two lottery jackpot tickets in the last week worth at least $4 million. The party store located at 16661 25 Mile Rd accomplished an extremely rare feat by selling the two tickets back-to-back.\\n\\n\\\"Obviously those are pretty steep odds to have a retailer sell two big winners like that,\\\" said Jeff Holyfield, public relations director for the Michigan Lottery. \\\"That's definitely the luckiest spot in Michigan right now.\\\"\\n\\nFirst came the news that one of two winning Lotto 47 tickets for a $9.6 million jackpot was sold at Silver House for the drawing on Wednesday, Oct. 10. Then word spread on Friday that a $4 million winner in the Super Raffle game was also sold at the store earlier in the month.\\n\\nIn fact, the winner of the Lotto 47 drawing told Michigan lottery officials the reason they bought their ticket at Silver House was because they heard the Super Raffle winner was sold there as well.\\n\\nThe extraordinary circumstances of the win has lottery players and people at the Michigan Lottery talking about just how odd it is that the winners were sold at the same retailer.\\n\\n\\\"Really for us, we're just like just about everybody else who says \\\"can you believe that? Isn't that amazing?\\\" Holyfield said. \\\"It's not impossible.... The winners just got lucky.\\\"\\n\\nIn his five years with the lottery, Holyfield can't remember one retailer having such luck in such a short period of time. A few years ago, a retailer outside of grand Rapids sold a pair of big winners in a short time, but Holyfield doesn't believe they were sold within a week of one another.\\n\\nMaking the feat even more remarkable is that the two winners were generated from two different systems on separate computers to generate the winning numbers.\\n\\n\\\"We don't have one universal system. We have different systems for different games,\\\" Holyfield said.\\n\\nWith the Super Raffle game, a computer randomly chose each winning ticket number from a list of the 300,000 tickets sold for the game. With the Lotto 47 game, a separate computer was used to generate the six random numbers with the perimeters of the game to determine those numbers.\\n\\nStaff at Silver House says people have already taken notice as non regular customers have been coming in all day to buy tickets as word of the store's luck spreads. A continuation of that stretch of luck would be much appreciated by lottery players in the area as the two huge jackpots have drawings this weekend.\\n\\nThanks to the two huge sales, the store's owners will receive a commission check for $5,000 for each ticket sold, meaning they'll pocket $10,000.\\n\\nFriday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $548 million while Saturday's Powerball jackpot is worth $314 million.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:10:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Michigan\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"44.25029"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-85.50033"},"__v":0}

The terms of the rights offering and other relevant information about the offering is included in the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus for the rights offering (the \\\"Prospectus\\\"). This document is not an offering, which can only be made by the Prospectus.\\n\\nThe Fund adopted a managed distribution plan and will make monthly distributions to common shareholders at an annual minimum fixed rate of 10%, based on the average monthly net asset value (NAV) of the Fund's common shares.

The distribution will be calculated as 10% of the previous month's average NAV, divided by 12. Management will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code.

(AP) Good luck trying to figure out what's going to happen when Oklahoma State visits Kansas State.\\n\\nBoth teams have been a mystery this season.\\n\\nThe Cowboys (4-2, 1-2) picked up a good non-conference win over Boise State, rapidly rose to No. 15 in the nation and had set their sights on competing for the Big 12 title. Then, they were throttled by Texas Tech, struggled against lowly Kansas and lost a week ago to Iowa State.\\n\\nThen there's the Wildcats (2-4, 0-3), who returned most of their key players from a team that won the Cactus Bowl last season. But beginning with a season-opening escape against South Dakota, the Wildcats have struggled to live up to expectations, their only win against a Football Bowl Subdivision opponent coming in their non-conference finale against UTSA.\\n\\n''Is there frustration? For sure, a lot of it,'' Kansas State offensive lineman Dalton Risner said. ''Is there a little bit of doubt sometimes? Yeah. A little bit of self-confidence, low self-confidence? Yeah, sometimes. But we're moving forward. We haven't taken any days off to where we're just feeling sorry for ourselves. I think that's really important.''\\n\\nIn fact, the Wildcats had a players-only meeting last week, a rarity for Bill Snyder's program. It lasted about 30 minutes and allowed the players to ''get some things off their chests,'' Risner said.\\n\\nNow, the question is whether it translates to improvement on the field.\\n\\n''If it's going to be productive, then I think it's appropriate,'' Snyder said. ''You've got to have a great deal of trust in your players to consent, to allow that to happen - although they have control over whether they get together or not. I think it went well from what I understand.''\\n\\nCowboys quarter Taylor Cornelius said no such meetings were needed in Stillwater.\\n\\n''It's always got to be positive. It's like any other week of preparation,'' he said.

(AP) -- Good luck trying to figure out what's going to happen when Oklahoma State visits Kansas State.\\n\\nBoth teams have been a mystery this season.\\n\\nThe Cowboys (4-2, 1-2) picked up a good non-conference win over Boise State, rapidly rose to No. 15 in the nation and had set their sights on competing for the Big 12 title. Then, they were throttled by Texas Tech, struggled against lowly Kansas and lost a week ago to Iowa State.\\n\\nThen there's the Wildcats (2-4, 0-3), who returned most of their key players from a team that won the Cactus Bowl last season. But beginning with a season-opening escape against South Dakota, the Wildcats have struggled to live up to expectations, their only win against a Football Bowl Subdivision opponent coming in their non-conference finale against UTSA.\\n\\n\\\"Is there frustration? For sure, a lot of it,\\\" Kansas State offensive lineman Dalton Risner said. \\\"Is there a little bit of doubt sometimes? Yeah. A little bit of self-confidence, low self-confidence? Yeah, sometimes. But we're moving forward. We haven't taken any days off to where we're just feeling sorry for ourselves.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc1014fd2ab6d5e306b3dca"},"title":"\"K-State looks toward season with Madness in Manhattan event\"","body":"\"MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas State coach Bruce Weber need only look at how difficult it was to build a schedule this season to know that his team, which returns all six guys who started every game on its Elite Eight run a year ago, is going to be a dangerous foe.\\n\\nWeber wanted to challenge those guys, rather than give them an easy road like he might a team full of newcomers. So he reached out to dozens of Power Five coaches.\\n\\n\\\"We thought we could get a higher BCS team at home this year and we just couldn't do it,\\\" he said. \\\"I had a lot of cuss words on text messages sent to me from a lot of coaches.\\\"\\n\\nThe Wildcats still have a decent schedule with games against Marquette, Missouri and Texas A\u0026M ahead of their Big 12 schedule. But the Wildcats, who began practice a couple weeks ago and held their annual Madness in Manhattan event Friday night, are still lacking that marquee home game.\\n\\nNo matter. They're happy to challenge themselves on the road, too.\\n\\n\\\"We've got a big year ahead of us,\\\" said junior forward Xavier Sneed, whose breakout performances in the NCAA Tournament helped the Wildcats advance to the second weekend. \\\"We're trying to win the Big 12 championship first off, and of course we want to go undefeated in our conference. Just having those goals in mind push us every day to keep going hard.\\\"\\n\\nIt would be easy to grow complacent, after all, given how many games the Wildcats' core group has played together. All-Big 12 forward Dean Wade and fellow senior Barry Brown join Sneed, senior point guard Kamau Stokes and junior big man Makol Mawien in lending the starting lineup experience.\\n\\nThrow in young guards Cartier Diarra and Mike McGuirl, who were pressed into critical minutes a year ago because of injuries, and the Wildcats also have depth that few teams enjoy.\\n\\n\\\"It's very competitive. We try to push each other every day and make each other better,\\\" Diarra said. \\\"It really comes down to team pace. Nobody cares about how many minutes they played. We just work hard and try to make each other better.\\\"\\n\\nThe Wildcats also addressed their biggest deficiency last season -- interior depth -- when they brought in 6-foot-7 junior college transfer Austin Trice. He'll compete with 6-11 sophomore James Love, redshirt freshman Nigel Shadd and bruiser Levi Stockard III for minutes off the bench.\\n\\n\\\"Ever since day one I found out that this team is very close, you know? We're like brothers, on and off the court,\\\" Trice said. \\\"So I feel like that's one of the main key points of our success, and how successful we'll be this year, because we work on an everyday culture.\\\"\\n\\nIt helps to be healthy, too.\\n\\nStokes missed time with a knee injury a couple years ago before missing much of last season with a broken foot. He eventually returned and started throughout the NCAA Tournament, but it never seemed as if the Wildcats' best distributor was quite as effective. Mawien got hurt during the offseason and wound up missing workouts throughout July, but Weber said the big man still managed to lift weights and put on some much-needed bulk.\\n\\n\\\"He really worked at it,\\\" Weber said. \\\"I would say he's 100 percent. Everyone gets worked up and has sore muscles after conditioning but he's doing fine and is ready to go.\\\"\\n\\nMost importantly so is Wade, who averaged 16.2 points and 6.2 rebounds last season before a foot injury limited him to just eight minutes total during the NCAA Tournament.\\n\\n\\\"It felt like I played all the hard parts of the season, then when we got to the fun part, I had to sit in timeout the whole time,\\\" Wade said. \\\"I'm feeling normal right now. There's days where sometimes I feel like my conditioning went down a little bit but ... I feel pretty normal right now.\\\"\\n\\nKansas State plays its lone exhibition game against Pittsburg State on Nov. 2. Then comes the opener against Kennesaw State a week later, and matchups against Denver and Eastern Kentucky before a trip to the Paradise Jam in the Virgin Islands.\\n\\n\\\"This group is very focused, very dedicated to being special and it's been fun,\\\" Weber said, \\\"the spring, summer and fall with them because they work really hard and I anticipate it will be fun through this early part of practice and getting ready.\\\"\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:10:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Manhattan\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"40.78343"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-73.96625"},"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc1014fd2ab6d5e306b3dce"},"title":"\"5 Key Moments In Jared Kushner's Bromance With Saudi Crown Prince\"","body":"\"WASHINGTON (JTA) -- In March, Saudi Arabia was on the brink of a new age of modernity. At the epicenter of the transformation were Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and top adviser.\\n\\nBut allegations this week that bin Salman -- or MBS, as he is known -- ordered the brazen murder of a dissident Saudi journalist in Istanbul, Turkey, have roiled the prince's reputation as a modernizer.\\n\\nSo where does that leave Kushner, who cultivated a close friendship with MBS in part to advance Kushner's efforts to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks? Does Kushner counsel the president to distance the United States from Saudi Arabia? Or does he wait out the storm and return to the bromance when things are quieter?\\n\\nDespite some favorable media coverage at the time of his last U.S. visit in March, much reporting suggested -- even before the disappearance in Istanbul last week of Jamal Khashoggi, a permanent resident of the United States -- that MBS's reforms were more show than substance.\\n\\nYes, women could drive, but the activists who helped bring about the change were languishing in jail. Yes, he seemed ready for closer relations with Israel, while also bombing Yemen into submission, with little regard for civilian casualties. Yes, the extended Saudi royal family seemed on board with his changes, but maybe a period of imprisonment and torture in 2017 had something to do with that.\\n\\nWith the Khashoggi crisis in full bloom, the Trump administration is scrambling for a strategy. Trump himself is wary of penalizing a nation that spends big money on U.S. arms.\\n\\n\\\"I don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's being poured into our country on -- I know they're talking about different kinds of sanctions,\\\" he said Thursday, referring to moves in Congress to sanction Saudi Arabia, \\\"but they're spending $110 billion on military equipment and on things that create jobs, like jobs and others, for this country.\\\"\\n\\nSaudi Arabia also figures large in Trump administration plans to isolate Iran.\\n\\nAt the center of the U.S.-Saudi relationship is Kushner, whom Trump has tasked with relaunching the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The drive for a peace deal is what ostensibly brought Kushner and MBS together, but their relationship has broadened to include arms sales and regional strategy making.\\n\\nHere are five key moments in the Kushner-MBS bromance.\\n\\nThe first meeting\\n\\nAccording to The Washington Post, MBS and Kushner became friendly when the crown prince first visited Trump as president in March 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was next on the agenda but was delayed by a snowstorm, which allowed the two 30-somethings to become acquainted. That set off a long distance relationship, with frequent phone calls, the Post reported.\\n\\nOpen arms and an arms deal\\n\\nOne result of the closeness was a major shift: A president's inaugural trip has traditionally been to a neighbor, Canada or Mexico. Trump instead first headed to Saudi Arabia, in May 2017, and Kushner was instrumental in setting the agenda -- so instrumental that he says he got a rabbi's permission to join his father-in-law on the Shabbat flight. (Which rabbi? That's still a mystery.)\\n\\nThe trip went off smoothly -- remember that glowing orb Trump and MBS's dad touched together? And Trump signed a $110 billion arms sale deal with the country.\\n\\nThat Lebanon business\\n\\nKushner visited with MBS in Saudi Arabia in October 2017, supposedly to discuss advance of the Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. A week or so later Saad Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, turned up in Saudi Arabia to resign, citing the overweening influence in his country of Hezbollah, the Shiite militia aligned with Iran.\\n\\nIt was a bizarre moment, and soon Hariri was back in Lebanon having rescinded his resignation. What happened?\\n\\nHariri has close business and family relations in Saudi Arabia, and MBS may have coerced his resignation as a means of sowing chaos in Lebanon, which he reportedly hoped would spark a punishing Israeli assault on Hezbollah. No one told the Israelis and they were not game to be Saudi Arabia's proxy in its longstanding dispute with Iran.\\n\\nDid Kushner give MBS a green light? They chatted until 4 a.m. during the visit. We may never know what they discussed, but the proximity (and secrecy) of his visit so close to the Lebanon fiasco led to speculation that Kushner winked at MBS's maneuvering. The crown prince arrested a bunch of his extended family at around the same time. That was the second round of arrests; the first was in June, soon after the Trump visit. Making matters murkier, Trump praised the prince for the arrests in a tweet.\\n\\nThat peace deal\\n\\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was summoned to Saudi Arabia the same month as Hariri, November 2017. What was said was not clear, but according to subsequent reports, MBS pressed Abbas to accept Kushner's terms for a peace deal that would comprise a Palestinian quasi state with its capital in Jerusalem's suburbs, as opposed to the city itself.\\n\\nAbbas reportedly declined, and Saudi statements denied that MBS had ever embraced such a proposal.\\n\\nOne year later ...\\n\\nA year after their snowbound bromance began, MBS was back in the United States for what was to be a turning point in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. He met with Trump, and Kushner helped organize a busy itinerary for the prince, including stops in high-tech centers on the East and West coasts to talk investment. MBS and his modernization proposals received glowing attention from influential columnists.\\n\\nMarring the visit was the revelation, first reported at the time by The Intercept, that MBS told Persian Gulf buddies that he had Kushner \\\"in his pocket.\\\"\\n\\nIs that the case? The Khashoggi mystery is not going away, and we may learn more soon.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:09:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington, D.C.\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"38.91706"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-77.00025"},"__v":0}

She gained herself a bit of publicity in March when she secured the release of Ru-El Sailor, a Cleveland man who spent 15 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.\\n\\nA self-described progressive, Corral said in an interview Friday that she disagrees with much of what Trump has done since taking office in January 2017, and has the Facebook posts to prove it.\\n\\nShe saw a window of opportunity, though, on criminal justice.\\n\\n\\\"I have a lot of problems with a lot of the president's policies but criminal justice reform, I think, is less partisan than other issues,\\\" Corral said.\\n\\nCorral was at the White House on Thursday as a guest of Cleveland Browns legend Jim Brown and his wife, which was supposed to focus on criminal justice reform. She also went to advocate for a client who is seeking clemency.\\n\\nShe found out the meeting would go forward last week and knew that the noted Chicago hip-hop artist, whose outlandish statements of late tend to outshine his music, would be there.\\n\\nThings didn't exactly go as planned.\\n\\nWest mostly took over the conversation, giving rambling speeches to the president and reporters on topics that included Hillary Clinton to his business prowess to how he thought that imprisoned notorious Chicago gang organizer Larry Hoover got a raw deal. He even said he wanted to be president one day.\\n\\nCorral said she thinks West is an artistic genius, but it was obvious something was off on that day.\\n\\n\\\"Yeah I was in awe of the moment,\\\" Corral said, explaining that this was the first time in the White House and meeting a president. \\\"A little bit of that gets lost, though, because in the moment you're like, 'What's going on here?'\\\"\\n\\nAs she stood there, her lawyering instincts came in to play. She wondered how she could steer the conversation back to the issues she cared about?\\n\\nCorral wondered if she could interject, but knew there was no reasonable way to do so. She laughed at moments where she thought West was being funny, but admitted that she felt uncomfortable at other points, especially when he spoke about how his masculinity would be affected had Clinton won the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\n\\\"I think it would be hard to say, 'alright, well actually can we talk about these three specific bullet points?'\\\" Corral said. \\\"The structure of the meeting sort of devolved and made that impossible.\\\"\\n\\nCorral noted that West brought up a lot of important issues, such as mental health, education, housing and prison reform. It just wasn't presented to the president in the best way, she said.\\n\\nCorral said she was able to speak to the president for a minute after the meeting and with the White House counsel about her client, whom she declined to name. She also said she wasn't sure if she actually shook West's hand, as there was a large group that introduced themselves before entering the Oval Office, including White House advisors Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\\n\\nAfter the meeting, Corral said friends started posting on her Facebook page. A few pointed to the picture and said it was her doppelganger but they slowly realized that it was actually her.\\n\\nShe left the experience not with a feeling of awkwardness or frustration, but with the sense that it was all entertainment.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't like there was a risk that it was going to get confrontational because obviously, for whatever reason which I'm not aware of, Donald Trump has an affinity for Kanye. He likes him a lot,\\\" Corral said. \\\"It might have been awkward for Kanye, but I don't think he had any awareness of that awkwardness, and everyone else was just taking it in.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:09:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Cleveland\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.4995"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-81.69541"},"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc1014fd2ab6d5e306b3dd4"},"title":"\"K-State looks toward season with Madness in Manhattan event\"","body":"\"MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas State coach Bruce Weber need only look at how difficult it was to build a schedule this season to know that his team, which returns all six guys who started every game on its Elite Eight run a year ago, is going to be a dangerous foe.\\n\\nWeber wanted to challenge those guys, rather than give them an easy road like he might a team full of newcomers. So he reached out to dozens of Power Five coaches.\\n\\n\\\"We thought we could get a higher BCS team at home this year and we just couldn't do it,\\\" he said. \\\"I had a lot of cuss words on text messages sent to me from a lot of coaches.\\\"\\n\\nThe Wildcats still have a decent schedule with games against Marquette, Missouri and Texas A\u0026M ahead of their Big 12 schedule. But the Wildcats, who began practice a couple weeks ago and held their annual Madness in Manhattan event Friday night, are still lacking that marquee home game.\\n\\nNo matter. They're happy to challenge themselves on the road, too.\\n\\n\\\"We've got a big year ahead of us,\\\" said junior forward Xavier Sneed, whose breakout performances in the NCAA Tournament helped the Wildcats advance to the second weekend. \\\"We're trying to win the Big 12 championship first off, and of course we want to go undefeated in our conference. Just having those goals in mind push us every day to keep going hard.\\\"\\n\\nIt would be easy to grow complacent, after all, given how many games the Wildcats' core group has played together. All-Big 12 forward Dean Wade and fellow senior Barry Brown join Sneed, senior point guard Kamau Stokes and junior big man Makol Mawien in lending the starting lineup experience.\\n\\nThrow in young guards Cartier Diarra and Mike McGuirl, who were pressed into critical minutes a year ago because of injuries, and the Wildcats also have depth that few teams enjoy.\\n\\n\\\"It's very competitive. We try to push each other every day and make each other better,\\\" Diarra said. \\\"It really comes down to team pace. Nobody cares about how many minutes they played. We just work hard and try to make each other better.\\\"\\n\\nThe Wildcats also addressed their biggest deficiency last season -- interior depth -- when they brought in 6-foot-7 junior college transfer Austin Trice. He'll compete with 6-11 sophomore James Love, redshirt freshman Nigel Shadd and bruiser Levi Stockard III for minutes off the bench.\\n\\n\\\"Ever since day one I found out that this team is very close, you know? We're like brothers, on and off the court,\\\" Trice said. \\\"So I feel like that's one of the main key points of our success, and how successful we'll be this year, because we work on an everyday culture.\\\"\\n\\nIt helps to be healthy, too.\\n\\nStokes missed time with a knee injury a couple years ago before missing much of last season with a broken foot. He eventually returned and started throughout the NCAA Tournament, but it never seemed as if the Wildcats' best distributor was quite as effective. Mawien got hurt during the offseason and wound up missing workouts throughout July, but Weber said the big man still managed to lift weights and put on some much-needed bulk.\\n\\n\\\"He really worked at it,\\\" Weber said. \\\"I would say he's 100 percent. Everyone gets worked up and has sore muscles after conditioning but he's doing fine and is ready to go.\\\"\\n\\nMost importantly so is Wade, who averaged 16.2 points and 6.2 rebounds last season before a foot injury limited him to just eight minutes total during the NCAA Tournament.\\n\\n\\\"It felt like I played all the hard parts of the season, then when we got to the fun part, I had to sit in timeout the whole time,\\\" Wade said. \\\"I'm feeling normal right now. There's days where sometimes I feel like my conditioning went down a little bit but ... I feel pretty normal right now.\\\"\\n\\nKansas State plays its lone exhibition game against Pittsburg State on Nov. 2. Then comes the opener against Kennesaw State a week later, and matchups against Denver and Eastern Kentucky before a trip to the Paradise Jam in the Virgin Islands.\\n\\n\\\"This group is very focused, very dedicated to being special and it's been fun,\\\" Weber said, \\\"the spring, summer and fall with them because they work really hard and I anticipate it will be fun through this early part of practice and getting ready.\\\"\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:08:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Manhattan\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"40.78343"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-73.96625"},"__v":0}

It facilitates the tracking and exchange of assets, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.\\n\\nTransactions are recorded as locked-in blocks of information that are available for all network users to see. As new transactions occur, they're added as blocks to the chain, allowing users to track and verify the history and current status of everything related to an asset or interaction.\\n\\nBeyond Bitcoin, the technology can allow businesses, government and others to securely handle everything from supply chain management to financial contracts in real time online.\\n\\nCNM, for example, says it became the first community college in the country to issue digital diplomas in December to a small group of graduates.

(AP) -- The Pennsylvania state lawmaker leading a push to give victims of child sexual abuse a way around time limits that prevent them from suing on Friday angrily rejected an alternative approach recently circulated by the top-ranking Senate Republican.\\n\\nRep. Mark Rozzi said he had several problems with a document he received Thursday from the office of Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, the biggest being that it did not include a two-year window to allow lawsuits otherwise barred by time limits in state law.\\n\\n\\\"As far as I'm concerned, negotiations are over. My three words for the Senate are simply this: prepare for war,\\\" Rozzi, D-Berks, said in his Capitol office. \\\"We're coming.\\\"\\n\\nA couple hours later his tone had cooled, saying at a news conference there was a chance an agreement could be struck over the weekend.\\n\\nThe House last month voted for a two-year window, but Scarnati has argued retroactive lawsuits would violate the state constitution. The Senate could vote on matter next week, as the current legislative session nears its end.\\n\\nA state investigative grand jury report issued in August, drawing from secret church files, found hundreds of Roman Catholic priests abused children over seven decades. It recommended a window be established because under current law, victims of child sexual abuse have until age 30 to sue.\\n\\nScarnati's top aide, Drew Crompton, described the document as a way to share information \\\"with a small group of interested parties in order to continue good faith conversations on behalf of Sen. Scarnati.\\\"\\n\\nThe document was first reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\\n\\nCrompton said Scarnati's proposal of a compensation fund was evidence the Senate leader has \\\"moved off his position.\\\" The outline he sent out Thursday talks of giving victims one year to file a claim with a \\\"tribunal, managed by judges\\\" that would oversee a victims' compensation fund. The document does not say where the money would come from, how much money would be available or who would be eligible.\\n\\nThe Scarnati document backs a widely supported proposal to eliminate the statute of limitations for criminal prosecutions going forward, and makes other changes recommended by the grand jury.\\n\\nIt would impose more strict requirements for reporting suspected abuse and make clear that nondisclosure agreements may not stop the victims who signed them from reporting their abuse to police. A registry would be established to list perpetrators.\\n\\nRozzi, who spoken publicly about his own abuse at the hands of Catholic priest, has become a House leader on the subject. He said he had been in talks with Scarnati over the bill, and on Tuesday Scarnati told him he would send him language.\\n\\nRozzi said he supports the idea of a compensation fund along with a two-year window for lawsuits -- but not a fund without the window.\\n\\nHe said the fund could end up as a way for the church and others to \\\"buy off these claims super cheap.\\\" Some victims, he said, want the kind of disclosure that a lawsuit could provide, while others prefer the process of compensation through a fund.\\n\\nSam Marshall, president of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, an industry group, responded favorably to the Scarnati document.\\n\\n\\\"This seems to be a comprehensive and constitutional approach to eradicating the horrors of child abuse documented in the grand jury report,\\\" Marshall said.\\n\\nThe state's Catholic dioceses have endorsed the idea of a fund.\\n\\nAt a news conference Friday morning in Norristown to push lawmakers to act in the coming days, Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro insisted that the two-year window should be part of legislation.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know how any responsible lawmaker who actually took the time to read this grand jury report could vote against these survivors, could vote against supporting these grand jury reforms,\\\" Shapiro said.\\n\\nHe said the grand jury report had shocked people in the state, and warned state senators not to ignore the grand jury's recommended changes.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP writer Claudia Lauer contributed from Norristown.\\n\\n___\\n\\nThis story has been corrected to say that Rozzi said \\\"prepare for war,\\\" not \\\"this is war.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:07:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"40.2737"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-76.88442"},"__v":0}

Gus Perna. \\\"We have to understand the situation and the environment so that we can provide what is needed before they have to ask for it.\\\"\\n\\nWith the pending release of Multi-Domain Operations doctrine, and the subsequent update of logistics doctrine, Perna challenged Army logistics leaders and industry to focus on five key areas:\\n\\n* Materiel readiness -- ensuring the right equipment is positioned in the right places with the right units, and with breadth and depth in the supply chain to ensure repair parts are available for both immediate and future requirements;\\n\\n* Munitions readiness -- receiving, storing and issuing munitions, with the right facilities, capabilities and sea and air transportation, for training and war;\\n\\n* Industrial Base readiness -- building a strong industrial base, both commercially and organic, that supports readiness today and maintains the ability to surge for future requirements;\\n\\n* Power Projection readiness -- increasing the ability to project the force by air, rail and sea, with Army Prepositioned Stocks maintained and ready to draw;\\n\\n* Enterprise Resource Planning readiness -- minimizing and connecting the multiple systems currently in use horizontally and vertically to create efficiencies and effectiveness.\\n\\n\\\"When they define the strategic rear, I want you to think five things,\\\" Perna said. \\\"Because if we don't get these five things right, if we don't get them to a place where they are our core competency, then it won't matter what we do on the battlefield.\\\"\\n\\nAddressing several logistics reform areas, AMC Deputy Commander Lt.

The command also divested nearly 1 million pieces of equipment, unburdening units from having to maintain it, freeing up storage space and saving costs of sustainment.\\n\\nThe command is also investing in the Army's Organic Industrial Base -- arsenals, depots and ammunition plants, most established during World War II -- bringing the \\\"20th century facilities into the 21st century,\\\" Daly said. The OIB manufactures and repairs equipment to support readiness today, while maintaining the capability to surge and ramp up in support of future wars.\\n\\n\\\"The bottom line is that we are leveraging the power of the OIB to drive and support readiness and modernization efforts,\\\" Daly said.\\n\\nFrom cyber to sustaining legacy systems, industry representatives in the audience asked panelists how they could be a part of the solution.

Then, they were throttled by Texas Tech, struggled against lowly Kansas and lost a week ago to Iowa State.\\n\\nThen there's the Wildcats (2-4, 0-3), who returned most of their key players from a team that won the Cactus Bowl last season. But beginning with a season-opening escape against South Dakota, the Wildcats have struggled to live up to expectations, their only win against a Football Bowl Subdivision opponent coming in their non-conference finale against UTSA.\\n\\n\\\"Is there frustration? For sure, a lot of it,\\\" Kansas State offensive lineman Dalton Risner said. \\\"Is there a little bit of doubt sometimes? Yeah. A little bit of self-confidence, low self-confidence? Yeah, sometimes. But we're moving forward. We haven't taken any days off to where we're just feeling sorry for ourselves. I think that's really important.\\\"\\n\\nIn fact, the Wildcats had a players-only meeting last week, a rarity for Bill Snyder's program. It lasted about 30 minutes and allowed the players to \\\"get some things off their chests,\\\" Risner said.\\n\\nNow, the question is whether it translates to improvement on the field.\\n\\n\\\"If it's going to be productive, then I think it's appropriate,\\\" Snyder said. \\\"You've got to have a great deal of trust in your players to consent, to allow that to happen -- although they have control over whether they get together or not. I think it went well from what I understand.\\\"\\n\\nCowboys quarter Taylor Cornelius said no such meetings were needed in Stillwater.\\n\\n\\\"It's always got to be positive. It's like any other week of preparation,\\\" he said. \\\"We're off of Iowa State and we're on to Kansas State, so it's just another week of preparation.\\\"\\n\\nAnother opportunity to rebound from a loss, too.\\n\\n\\\"We're ready to go. We want to bounce back and we know that anything is possible,\\\" Cowboys running back Chuba Hubbard said. \\\"It might've gotten off to a rough start, but we're going to finish strong.\\\"\\n\\nCLOSE DOESN'T COUNT\\n\\nKansas State had a chance to score a go-ahead touchdown against Texas a couple weeks ago but couldn't move the ball in a 19-14 loss. The Wildcats also led Baylor in the fourth quarter a week ago before watching the Bears kick the winning field goal with 8 seconds left.\\n\\n\\\"Playing well for three quarters is good,\\\" Snyder said, \\\"but doesn't get the job done.\\\"\\n\\nPASS-IVE DEFENSE\\n\\nOklahoma State allowed third-string quarterback Brock Purdy to go 18 of 23 for 318 yards and four touchdowns in last week's loss to Iowa State. That would be encouraging for Kansas State if only the Wildcats had any semblance of a passing game.\\n\\n\\\"They run their quarterback a lot,\\\" Oklahoma State linebacker Justin Phillips said. \\\"They have some big dudes up front that they utilize and tighten up a little bit. They just get behind their big guys and try to run the ball.\\\"\\n\\nBEWARE THE BIG PLAY\\n\\nThe Cyclones managed to hit the Cowboys with several big plays, including five touchdowns of at least 20 yards.\\n\\n\\\"Defensively, we can't give up the big plays. You have to try to defend the deep ball better,\\\" Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. \\\"Our guys are getting violated with our eyes, getting caught in the backfield and getting run by. We just have to tighten it down.\\\"\\n\\nRUNNING BACK SHOWDOWN\\n\\nIn the pass-happy Big 12, good luck finding a better matchup of running backs than the Cowboys' Justice Hill and the Wildcats' Alex Barnes. Hill has four 100-yard rushing games while Barnes is coming off a 250-yard, three-touchdown effort at Baylor.\\n\\nTIGHT SERIES\\n\\nThe last three meetings of Oklahoma State and Kansas State, and four of the last five, have been decided by six points or fewer.\\n\\n\\\"The games are always fun,\\\" Risner said. \\\"They're a prolific offense, they put points up on the board and they're a good football team every year. It's fun playing a team like them, and they're a good team every year, so I really enjoy it.\\\"\\n\\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:04:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Manhattan, Kansas\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"39.18361"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-96.57167"},"__v":0}

He was not with the team at Friday's shootaround in Milwaukee.\\n\\nCoach Tom Thibodeau, speaking publicly for the first time since Wednesday's practice, said Butler was doing conditioning work in Minneapolis and had not been suspended.\\n\\nAsked if Butler would play in Minnesota's regular-season opener at San Antonio next Wednesday, Thibodeau said: \\\"The situation remains fluid.\\\"\\n\\nButler told ESPN following Wednesday's practice that his issues with the Timberwolves have not been fixed.\\n\\n\\\"Let's just be honest. It could be,\\\" Butler said in the interview. \\\"But do I think so? No.\\\"\\n\\nCenter Karl-Anthony Towns would not address what happened at that practice or whether a players' meeting was held Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"I think the only thing that needs to be clarified is we're excited to pick up a basketball here today in Milwaukee,\\\" Towns said. Asked if he would be happy to play with Butler in the season opener, Towns said, \\\"I'm happy to play basketball with anybody.\\\"\\n\\nButler will be a free agent at the end of the season and would be eligible to sign a five-year deal with Minnesota at that point. Young stars Towns and Andrew Wiggins have signed five-year contracts with the team.\\n\\nTimberwolves forward Taj Gibson, who played with Butler in Chicago, said he did not think Wednesday's practice was out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\\\"I felt it was like a normal practice, but it was new for guys,\\\" Gibson said. \\\"It's only our second year together (in Minnesota), but I've been around Jimmy for a long time.\\n\\n\\\"We always had practices like that in Chicago,\\\" Gibson added. \\\"It was always a good competition, and at the end of the practice everybody shook up and we still understood we were teammates.\\\"\\n\\nButler told ESPN he was waiting for one of his teammates to stand up to him, but it never happened.\\n\\n\\\"If we would have thought it was serious, we would have, but we didn't think it was that serious,\\\" Gibson said. \\\"It was just guys being competitive and going at it in practice ... I was just used to playing guys growing up, talking trash and having fun at the same time.\\\"\\n\\nThe saga with the four-time All-Star started in mid-September, when it became known that Butler told Thibodeau that he wanted a trade after a season in which he was Minnesota's leading scorer and helped the Wolves snap a 14-year playoff drought.\\n\\nThe Timberwolves have had talks with several teams. Thibodeau has said any deal must be in the best interest of the Timberwolves.\\n\\nThibodeau said some of what was reported in the aftermath of the practice was incorrect, but he declined to elaborate.\\n\\n\\\"It's not uncommon when players scrimmage that there will be some talk,\\\" Thibodeau said. \\\"It was competitive.\\\"\\n\\nAsked if he was pleased with the practice, Thibodeau said: \\\"You're never pleased with practice.

He acknowledged his team would have to deal with the constant media attention over the situation and whether Butler will be traded.\\n\\n\\\"That's the challenge of the NBA,\\\" Thibodeau said. \\\"Every team is going to through something at some point of the season. For us it's early on and the challenge is not to get distracted, to get ready for the season.\\\"\\n\\nButler was brought to Minnesota prior to last season to reunite with Thibodeau, the former Bulls coach, and bring leadership to a young team.

(Simmons) being eligible, it's backup receivers doing a better job and maturing and playing better, and then it's getting our running backs involved as well.\\n\\n\\\"That's probably the biggest difference (from last season), scheme-wise, is they have to account for those backs.\\\"\\n\\nIt goes beyond that, though. You have Sills and Jennings and Grier all working together in the system for a second year with Grier's confidence having been won over by Simms and Simmons, to say nothing of the backs and -- yes -- tight ends.\\n\\nIn fact, in last week's victory over Kansas Grier threw touchdown passes to four different players and only one of them was a wide receiver, David Sills. Two went to running backs Leddie Brown and Martell Pettaway and another to tight end Jovani Haskins.\\n\\nAnd, just so Kansas didn't feel left out, he also threw three passes to Jayhawks in the end zone ... but those were interceptions and you hear no one bragging on them around the Puskar Center this week.\\n\\nIt's been interesting to see the development of Simms and Simmons, the Alabama transfer, who stepped up big time against KU when Simms slipped after having put together three consecutive 100-yard receiving games.\\n\\n\\\"T.J. probably played the best out of all of those guys last week. (He) was pretty consistent and made some plays,\\\" Holgorsen said. \\\"Gary and David do things that is just routine at this point and that's pretty good.\\n\\n\\\"Marcus had a couple of games where he played pretty good. I don't think he quite did what we need him to do last week but T.J. has been solid. I've been pleased with the backups as well.\\\"\\n\\nDepth in the receiving corps has lifted a burden off the offense, of Grier and, maybe most of all, off Holgorsen.\\n\\n\\\"There have been plenty of years when I've been sitting here pulling what hair I have left out over (our wide receiver backups),\\\" Holgorsen admitted.\\n\\nBut the likes of Dominque Maiden and Tevin Bush have become touchdown scoring contributors and there is a freshman Sam Jones ready to make an impact now.\\n\\nAnd then there's the tight ends -- Trevon Wesco and Jovani Haskins -- both now proven as receivers.\\n\\n\\\"The tight ends take one of those guys off the field a lot, so we don't have to play four wide receivers all the time. It makes it harder for us to game plan against when all of those guys are capable of making a play,\\\" Holgorsen said.\\n\\nThe variety and versatility makes life far better for Grier.\\n\\n\\\"I'm very comfortable with all of our guys. I think we have a lot of weapons, and it's good to be able to spread the ball around. All of these guys can make plays, and it's my job to make the right reads and get us in good plays and get the ball in their hands,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Like I said, I think we're doing a lot of things well, and we're close to playing complete games and really ironing all of this stuff out. We're right there, we just need to make a few more adjustments and continue to get better.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You see Will having the comfort to be able to distribute the ball like he is right now,\\\" offensive coordinator Jake Spavital said. \\\"I don't know how many guys are touching the ball per game, but it's a good amount. That's what you want to get to, where when you're looking at us from a scouting report, there's a lot of people across the board getting touches.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then you have option read routes to wide receivers that have been breaking open and it's almost as if the defense doesn't have enough people to cover everyone.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:03:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Morgantown, West Virginia\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"39.62953"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-79.9559"},"__v":0}

The firm has and has offices in Tennessee, including one in Kingsport, Alabama, Georgia, Ohio and Texas. The contract is for $17,750.\\n\\n\\\"This is something that is long overdue,\\\" board President Carrie Upshaw said before the vote. Kennedy students in the audience gave coyote howls following the vote. (The school mascot is the Coyote.)\\n\\nThe school system funding is an about-face from a former policy that playgrounds were funded by donations and school fundraisers, such as walk-a-thons by students and a half-marathon fundraiser by Kennedy Principal Janice Irvin, who raised almost $30,000 for the project in the Flying Pig race in her hometown of Cincinnati.\\n\\nEQUIPMENT MAY DATE BACK TO 1950S\\n\\nIrvin said parents have told her much of the playground equipment at the school dates back to its days as a Sullivan County school and that some pieces are likely from the 1950s. Aside from her $29,100 from the half-marathon, a student walkathon raised $5,000 and student Layne Knight raised $500 through her church, Morrison Chapel United Methodist. The original estimate or goal was $160,000. Irvin said the Parent Teacher Association at the school is actively raising money this academic year but likely will not earmark any funds for the project until the spring.\\n\\n\\\"I have met with the (school) district Administration and the Procurement Department and we are moving forward pending Board of Education approval,\\\" Irvin said recently. Since the school board approved professional services for the project, she said a scope of the bid will be developed.\\n\\nWHAT DOES THURSDAY VOTE MEAN?\\n\\n\\\"This is the start of the scope of work,\\\" Assistant Superintendent of Schools Andy True said Thursday before the meeting.\\n\\nThe firm will develop the bid specifications so the project can put put out to bid. Unlike the Johnson \\\"castle\\\" playground project, funded by private donations and school fundraising and scheduled for a community build in March of 2019, the Kennedy project will be paid for by a mixture of school fundraising and school system dollars.\\n\\n\\\"I am hopeful that our school will have a new playground by the end of this (2018-19) school year,\\\" Irvin said, a timeline True agreed could become reality. Some of the newer playground elements may remain in place, but she said most of the playground equipment is past its prime by far.\\n\\nPROJECT GOT NATIONAL READERSHIP\\n\\nThe Associated Press picked up an article about the Kennedy playground predicament, and it appeared on newspaper websites across the United States, which gave Irvin hope that a benefactor might come forward (possibly someone like talk show host Ellen Degeneres, who, like Oprah Winfrey, is known for helping fund worthy projects) to pitch in.\\n\\nHowever, it wasn't a national figure that came to the rescue by the school board. During a retreat this summer, the board reached a consensus that it would reverse its policy of not funding school playgrounds, and given the condition of the Kennedy playground indicated it likely would be first in line.\\n\\nStill, there is time for Ellen Degeneres and others to help.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T20:02:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Kingsport, Tennessee\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"36.54843"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-82.56182"},"__v":0}

A disgraced Lakewood contractor that News 5 has been investigating for months now faces a total of three felony theft charges, accused of bilking his customers out of tens and thousands of dollars.\\n\\nMichael Delmonico, 42, has been indicted by a grand jury on two additional felony grand theft charges. Delmonico, the former owner and operator of Pro Code Construction, was already facing a felony grand theft charge out of Lakewood Municipal Court. He has pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nAccording to court documents, the allegations against Delmonico stem from three past home renovation projects that Delmonico accepted money for but never performed the work. Customers' down payments were never returned, according to court documents.\\n\\nNews 5 has been investigating Delmonico since February. He has left a trail of unfinished projects and unhappy customers dating back to early 2017.\\n\\nRELATED: Home remodel gone wrong leads to lawsuit\\n\\nDelmonico was also the subject of a civil lawsuit brought forth by Rocky River homeowners Pat and Lori Smith. The couple's home was left in a state of disarray; wood-framed walls were left exposed, electrical lines were connected and an addition wasn't properly secured to the existing structure. The cost of fixing the efforts, the Smiths said, has topped $100,000.\\n\\nThere were also cases in which Delmonico reportedly never started construction despite taking thousands of dollars.\\n\\nAccording to a Lakewood police report, in December 2017, Delmonico was paid by a homeowner to renovate the kitchen at the woman's home on Franklin Avenue. The woman paid Delmonico up front so he could order materials for the renovation. By April 2018, nearly five months after the contract was signed, work on the kitchen had not even started, the report said.\\n\\nRELATED: Contractor barred from Westlake after failing to properly register during botched project\\n\\nAccording to the report, the homeowner demanded her money back from Delmonico, but he refused, telling her that his company was filing for bankruptcy protection and that he would not be refunding her. The homeowner believes Delmonico took the money with no intentions of performing the work, the report states. Delmonico was not allowed to file for bankruptcy again until October 2018 because of a past bankruptcy filing.\\n\\nAfter his arraignment on Friday morning, Delmonico was contrite but denied culpability.\\n\\n\\\"I never meant to do anything wrong. I just feel horrible. This has changed my whole life. And it's something I wouldn't want anybody to go through,\\\" Delmonico said. \\\"It's just tragic. It's tragic for me.\\\"\\n\\nBut it's really tragic for Delmonico's alleged victims, many of whom lost more than $15,000 after he allegedly walked off the job site.\\n\\nAccording to a Westlake police report, Timothy and Joyce Conway hired Pro Code Construction in September 2017 after using Home Advisor, a referral website that connects contractors and potential customers. After paying Delmonico more than $23,000 in two separate checks, construction on the kitchen remodel never started. When the Conways asked to have their money back, Delmonico reportedly told them to contact his bankruptcy attorney, according to the police report.\\n\\nThe Conways told News 5 on Friday afternoon that Delmonico pressured them into signing a contract quickly after receiving the estimate.\\n\\n\\\"[Delmonico] belongs in a place where all he does is make license plates,\\\" Tim Conway said.\\n\\nDelmonico repeatedly denied that he knowingly and intentionally deceived his customers out of their hard-earned money.\\n\\n\\\"I don't have a record of this. I don't. I would never take anything from anyone. Anyone that knows me, I wouldn't take anything from anyone. Ever,\\\" Delmonico said.\\n\\nHis former customers, however, would argue the exact opposite.\\n\\n\\\"I've never done anything intentionally. Ever,\\\" Delmonico said. \\\"Things just went wrong. It was just - it was just like any business. There's ups and downs. And there's a lot of downs.\\n\\nDelmonico also added that his business' death spiral began when he began taking out high interest or \\\"hard money\\\" loans. He said the interest payments soon became insurmountable. However, Delmonico's victims allege he took their down payment money but never intended to perform the work. When asked why he didn't refund his customers' money, Delmonico refused to elaborate.\\n\\n\\\"That's all I can say right now. Thank you,\\\" Delmonico said as he went on the elevator.\\n\\nDespite facing criminal charges and a settled civil lawsuit, Pro Code Construction was still listed on Home Advisor until News 5 brought the issues to the website's attention. The posting has since been removed and Pro Code's offices in Lakewood have shut down.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T19:59:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Cleveland\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.4995"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-81.69541"},"__v":0}

Thibodeau has said any deal must be in the best interest of the Timberwolves.\\n\\nThibodeau said some of what was reported in the aftermath of the practice was incorrect, but he declined to elaborate.\\n\\n\\\"It's not uncommon when players scrimmage that there will be some talk,\\\" Thibodeau said. \\\"It was competitive.\\\"\\n\\nAsked if he was pleased with the practice, Thibodeau said: \\\"You're never pleased with practice.

But it is definitely a presence that is felt, and \\\"if you are involved in it, it's a huge part of your life here at school.\\\"\\n\\nBut now, like at many other colleges and universities in Pennsylvania and across the nation, that Greek Life role is coming under increased scrutiny in the wake of an alleged hazing incident that's led to a temporary suspension of all new member education / induction activities.\\n\\nDetails are sketchy about the Bloomsburg incident. The university has refused to release any details other than to refer to \\\"allegations of hazing\\\"; the student grapevine suggests it may have been triggered by a parental complaint after one or more students received treatment at the local hospital for excessive drinking.\\n\\nThe suspension comes in the middle of the school's fall pledge period: New members have accepted bids to their respective chapters, and have entered a period of orientation on their way to full membership where most incidents of hazing typically occur.\\n\\nBut the message seems clear enough:\\n\\nBloomsburg, in the wake of the highly-publicized death of Timothy Piazza at nearby Penn State, does not want to be the next college or university with a hazing-related death on its hands.\\n\\nNon-Greek students who spoke to PennLive during a recent visit were, for the most part, just fine with that.\\n\\nAs for Greek students? Attempts to engage several fraternity and sorority members Thursday were all met with the same response, generally following the lines that \\\"we've been told not to talk about it.\\\"\\n\\nSeparate messages left with leaders of the campus-wide Greek letter councils were not responded to.\\n\\nOne sorority member who did talk, on the understanding that she would not give her name, said \\\"we don't see this as a big deal... We don't know how long it's going to be, but once the investigation is over we're still going to get our same new members.\\\"\\n\\nBut the independent students seemed universally pleased Bloomsburg was taking the opportunity to react before a much more serious incident occurred.\\n\\n\\\"With any fraternity or sorority there's going to be some kind of hazing, but there's always a line to it, and for the university, I think that line's been crossed,\\\" said Ben Finkbeiner, a junior from Carlisle.\\n\\n\\\"I totally agree with what they're doing.\\\"\\n\\nThere are 25 social fraternities and sororities at Bloomsburg. Taken together, they account for somewhere between 700 and 1,100 members, depending upon the data set you look at.\\n\\nMany sit in a stretch of homes along Bloomsburg's Lightstreet Road, just across the street from the official campus line. That puts them within the jurisdiction of Bloomsburg's municipal police force.\\n\\nChief Roger Van Loan knows it well.\\n\\n\\\"Fraternities and sororities account for more than their fair share of our calls for service while the university is in session,\\\" Van Loan said this week.\\n\\nThe bulk of those calls are for drunk and disorderly behavior growing out of large parties, and the noise complaints and property damage that radiates out from that.\\n\\nVan Loan said he was notified of the Oct. 5 suspension of pledging activity by university administrators, but his force is not directly involved in any corresponding criminal investigation at this point.\\n\\nA five-year assessment of Greek Life at Bloomsburg completed this January found 25 formal complaints of Code of Conduct violations involving fraternities and sororities between 2012 and 2017.\\n\\nMore than half involved hazing.\\n\\nBut the consultants who compiled the assessment said they were concerned -- based on other anecdotal sources -- that there is a strong likelihood of under-reporting of incidents and expressed concern about a \\\"very high-risk Greek environment,\\\" especially within the fraternities.\\n\\nThat's nothing new to students here at the state-owned university in the county seat of Columbia County, about 75 miles north of Harrisburg.\\n\\n\\\"Bloomsburg has always been kind of a drinking town, because there's not a whole lot to do,\\\" a student who only offered her first name, Alexa, said Thursday as she walked through the downtown.\\n\\nAs for the fraternities, \\\"It's kind of a, go-at-your-own-risk, do-your-own-research kind of a deal,\\\" the Blue Bell, Montgomery County native added.\\n\\n\\\"It definitely depends what fraternity you're going for,\\\" Finkbeiner said. \\\"But just judging from what I've seen, I could totally see that (a hazing-related tragedy) happening here.\\\"\\n\\nStudents also said they believe the conditions that have spawned the suspension of pledge education are pretty similar to past years, and it's the sensitivity to them - post-Piazza - that is heightened.\\n\\nPiazza, 19, died in February 2017, after a series of drunken falls during a party to celebrate his pledging with the now-closed Beta Theta Pi chapter there.\\n\\nThe Piazza case is one of several nationally that seems to focused a new energy on fraternity behavior, including a set of self-imposed reforms agreed to by the North American Intrafraternity Conference earlier this year.\\n\\nIn some ways, Bloomsburg has already seen similar tragedy: just not this generation of students.\\n\\nIn 1994, five students were killed in a fire that broke out at a fraternity house just hours after a homecoming party. Investigation showed that batteries had been reomved from the building's smoke detectors, a common practice during smoke-filled parties.\\n\\nThree more were killed in a separate fraternity house fire in 2000, again one that followed a party.\\n\\nIn that context, many students who are not part of the Greek system said they hope the current review - which the university is assigning to a yet-to-be-named external investigator - will be a step toward helping Bloomsburg shed a longstanding reputation as a party school.\\n\\n\\\"Booze-burg,\\\" some have referred to it in the past; the place where the town is overrun during the spring \\\"Block Party\\\" that Van Loan notes typically results in hundreds of arrests through the course of the weekend.\\n\\nOf course, the university is much more than a source of behavorial problems; aside from providing higher education to about 9,000 undergrads, it is a full-blown economic engine for surrounding area.\\n\\nStudents wear their \\\"Huskies\\\" apparel proudly, and it's not uncommon for families to send successive generations of kids here. They also know that logo can be badly scarred if a school gets to be known as 'that place where...'\\n\\n\\\"I have a feeling that once the investigations go down, they're going to find more than one\\\" place where hazing violations have occurred, said Loch, the student from Etters.\\n\\n\\\"I am happy that we're trying to take action and stop this, before something happens like it did at Penn State.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T19:58:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.0037"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-76.45495"},"__v":0}

Another sack was credited toward the team (that coming against the Rams on what was Seattle's only sack of the game when Goff just lost the ball out of his hands with Los Angeles recovering for an eight-yard loss, the play officially ruled a sack).\\n\\nA pass rush would be nice to have Sunday against an Oakland team that has plenty of wards overall but also has the ninth most passing attempts in the NFL while allowing just 11 sacks, with Derek Carr ranking sixth in passing yards per game at 328.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to get pressure on these guys for these quarterbacks to stop making these throws and take some pressure off our DBs (defensive backs),'' Clark said after Sunday's loss to the Rams.\\n\\nAsked the problem, Clark said \\\"just communication and we've got to execute. We've got to communicate and know the call, and that's everybody across the board.''\\n\\nIndeed, PFF excuses almost no one for Seattle's pass rush issues.\\n\\nClark is Seattle's highest-rated pass rusher, according to PFF, at 35 out of 112 edge rushers.\\n\\nOf the rest of Seattle's rushers with enough snaps to qualify, Reed is 70 of 119 interior defenders, Quinton Jefferson 84 of 112 edge rushers, and rookie Rasheem Green 110 of 112 edge rushers.\\n\\nGreen was a preseason standout but after a slow start has also been injured and will miss his second straight game against the Raiders with a sprained ankle.\\n\\nThe team also had high hopes that Dion Jordan would be a consistent pass rusher this season, with the plan that he would replace some -- if not quite a bit -- of the production of Michael Bennett, who was traded to the Eagles in March.\\n\\nBut after signing a restricted free agent tender paying him $1.9 million this year, Jordan has battled injuries, missing all of training camp with a stress reaction in his leg.\\n\\nHe also missed the Arizona game with a knee injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against the Raiders with a knee issue (he had another offseason surgery on his knee).\\n\\nThe upshot is that Jordan has played just 70 snaps with two tackles, one quarterback hit and no sacks after having been one of the pleasant surprises of the 2017 season when he had four sacks and 18 tackles in five games.\\n\\n\\\"Dion has been making progress,'' Carroll said Friday. \\\"He's been nursing his knee coming back. It hasn't been exactly perfect for him yet but we're working our way through it and he's been a solid performer so far. I don't think he's found his best game yet, but that's still out there for him.\\\"\\n\\nThe Seahawks hope sooner rather than later, as does Jordan, who some thought before the year might be in line for an extension but for now has to show he can be a consistent producer over a 16-game season to really factor into the team's long-range plans.\\n\\nAlso disappointing has been the pass rush from any of the team's tackles other than Reed.\\n\\nFree agent signee Shamar Stephen plays mostly on first- and second-downs, but has just one quarterback hit this season and no sacks, and Seattle only got one game out of fellow free agent Tom Johnson before losing him when the team released him for the Chicago game with plans to sign him back, only to see Johnson decide to return to the Vikings.\\n\\nEven more mysterious has been the disappearance of second-year player Nazair Jones, who showed a lot of promise as a rookie in 2017 with two sacks in 11 games before his season was cut short due to injury.\\n\\nJones has been an almost total non-factor this year, playing just 26 snaps and inactive despite being healthy for two games, including last week against the Rams, with no sacks and just one quarterback hit, appearing to have fallen behind rookie undrafted free agent Poona Ford in the defensive tackle rotation.\\n\\nAsked about Jones last week, Carroll didn't really provide any insight saying \\\"he's been rolling in there. Naz has done fine so far in the role we've asked him (to be in). He's been in and out of the active roster a little bit, but he's versatile. ... right now, he's rolling and he's trying to just get more plays by competing to get them.\\\"\\n\\nWherever they can get a pass rush from, the Seahawks will take it.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T19:56:00.000Z"},"location":"\"London\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"51.50853"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-0.12574"},"__v":0}

He was not with the team at Friday's shootaround in Milwaukee.\\n\\nCoach Tom Thibodeau, speaking publicly for the first time since Wednesday's practice, said Butler was doing conditioning work in Minneapolis and had not been suspended.\\n\\nAsked if Butler would play in Minnesota's regular-season opener at San Antonio next Wednesday, Thibodeau said: ''The situation remains fluid.''\\n\\nButler told ESPN following Wednesday's practice that his issues with the Timberwolves have not been fixed.\\n\\n''Let's just be honest. It could be,'' Butler said in the interview. ''But do I think so? No.''\\n\\nCenter Karl-Anthony Towns would not address what happened at that practice or whether a players' meeting was held Thursday.\\n\\n''I think the only thing that needs to be clarified is we're excited to pick up a basketball here today in Milwaukee,'' Towns said. Asked if he would be happy to play with Butler in the season opener, Towns said, ''I'm happy to play basketball with anybody.''\\n\\nButler will be a free agent at the end of the season and would be eligible to sign a five-year deal with Minnesota at that point. Young stars Towns and Andrew Wiggins have signed five-year contracts with the team.\\n\\nTimberwolves forward Taj Gibson, who played with Butler in Chicago, said he did not think Wednesday's practice was out of the ordinary.\\n\\n''I felt it was like a normal practice, but it was new for guys,'' Gibson said. ''It's only our second year together (in Minnesota), but I've been around Jimmy for a long time.\\n\\n''We always had practices like that in Chicago,'' Gibson added. ''It was always a good competition, and at the end of the practice everybody shook up and we still understood we were teammates.''\\n\\nButler told ESPN he was waiting for one of his teammates to stand up to him, but it never happened.\\n\\n''If we would have thought it was serious, we would have, but we didn't think it was that serious,'' Gibson said. ''It was just guys being competitive and going at it in practice ... I was just used to playing guys growing up, talking trash and having fun at the same time.''\\n\\nThe saga with the four-time All-Star started in mid-September, when it became known that Butler told Thibodeau that he wanted a trade after a season in which he was Minnesota's leading scorer and helped the Wolves snap a 14-year playoff drought.\\n\\nThe Timberwolves have had talks with several teams. Thibodeau has said any deal must be in the best interest of the Timberwolves.\\n\\nThibodeau said some of what was reported in the aftermath of the practice was incorrect, but he declined to elaborate.\\n\\n''It's not uncommon when players scrimmage that there will be some talk,'' Thibodeau said. ''It was competitive.''\\n\\nAsked if he was pleased with the practice, Thibodeau said: ''You're never pleased with practice. You're always striving for it to be as good as possible.''\\n\\nThibodeau said he would not comment on Butler's reported criticism of Towns and Wiggins. He acknowledged his team would have to deal with the constant media attention over the situation and whether Butler will be traded.\\n\\n''That's the challenge of the NBA,'' Thibodeau said. ''Every team is going to through something at some point of the season. For us it's early on and the challenge is not to get distracted, to get ready for the season.''\\n\\nButler was brought to Minnesota prior to last season to reunite with Thibodeau, the former Bulls coach, and bring leadership to a young team. The Timberwolves reached the playoffs last season and lost to Houston in the first round.\\n\\n''The biggest job of a leader, in my eyes, is to unite and inspire,'' Thibodeau said. ''It's OK to confront, that's not an issue. But if you do confront, don't beat down.''\\n\\nNotes: Wiggins was not with the team Friday because he is expecting a baby.\\n\\n---\\n\\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\\n\\nRecent NBA Discussions |get real ielts without exams in kuwait|buy ielts certificate in Saudi Arabia|get real ielts without exams in Kuwait|buy ielts certificate in oman|where to buy ielts certificate in Korea on Thu, Oct 2018 by seanmilesTie in Basketball Game - Wager Outcome? on Tue, Oct 2018 by StrakeyWNBA Betting News and Trends For Sunday 7/15/18 on Sun, Jul 2018 by ShazmanGame 4 NBA finals on Sat, Jun 2018 by shawnsushiNBA Betting News and Trends For Friday 6/8/18 on Fri, Jun 2018 by Shazman Forum Home | More Basketball Discussion\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T19:53:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Milwaukee\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"43.0389"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-87.90647"},"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc282ed54bb9c37288d3e4d"},"title":"\"Larry Fitzgerald brings lasting legacy to what looks like his...\"","body":"\"MINNEAPOLIS -- In January 2010, Kurt Warner was on an airplane with Larry Fitzgerald when the veteran quarterback informed his top receiver he would be retiring from the NFL.\\n\\nWarner and Fitzgerald played together for five seasons with the Arizona Cardinals and helped lead the franchise to its only Super Bowl, a last-minute loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009.\\n\\nWhen Warner finished telling Fitzgerald his plans, the receiver had some news for him. In 2005, when Warner joined the Cardinals, the quarterback told Fitzgerald he wasn't working hard enough and needed to commit himself more to become great.\\n\\n\\\"Five years later, he told me, 'I'll never forget that conversation that you had with me,' \\\" Warner said. \\\"He said it motivated him from that moment on like, 'Why don't I want to be the best?' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald, a Minneapolis native and former local prep star, developed into one of the top receivers in NFL history. In his 15th season, he ranks among the best receivers of all time: third in receptions (1,251), third in receiving yards (15,721) and eighth in receiving touchdowns (110).\\n\\nOn Sunday, Oct. 14, Fitzgerald, 35, will make what could be the final appearance of his career in his hometown when the Cardinals (1-4) face the Vikings (2-2-1) at U.S. Bank Stadium. Many believe this will be his final NFL season.\\n\\nFitzgerald, a Vikings ball boy during the Dennis Green era, said he won't decide on his future until after the season. He did reflect, though, on his illustrious NFL career.\\n\\nAfter being taken by the Cardinals with the No. 3 pick in the 2004 draft, Fitzgerald had a good-but-not-great rookie season, catching 58 passes for 780 yards. A year later, Warner, who led the St. Louis Rams to two Super Bowls, including a victory in January 2000, arrived in Arizona.\\n\\nAfter watching the cocky young receiver in practice, Warner told him he had better wide receivers with the Rams in Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt.\\n\\n\\\"You could see the upside of this kid, but at the same time you could also see that he didn't necessarily understand how to play the game, like the little nuances of being a great route runner,\\\" said Warner, who was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and is now an NFL Network analyst. \\\"So we were at dinner and I shared that with him, and his response was kind of like, 'I'm pretty good. I'm good enough right now. We've got bigger problems in Arizona than me.' \\\"\\n\\nBest friends now\\n\\nSlowly, Warner's words sank in, and Fitzgerald eventually took that advice to heart. He improved quickly, and led the NFL in receiving in 2005 with 103 catches for 1,409 yards, securing a spot in the first of his 11 Pro Bowls.\\n\\n\\\"I was like most 21-year-olds,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"You just think your stuff doesn't stink and (Warner) served me a small splash of the humble pie, which I needed. I didn't take it personally. I just took it as a challenge. ... I was very grateful that he came along in my life, my career, at the time. I really needed that leadership and that challenge to take my game to the next level.\\\"\\n\\nWarner said he and Fitzgerald eventually became best friends, and said it's been an \\\"honor to see him grow into the person he's become.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald has gone from a cocky kid to a wise NFL veteran. First-year Cardinals coach Steve Wilks was impressed immediately with Fitzgerald's leadership abilities.\\n\\n\\\"Everything you see that's advertised is totally true,\\\" Wilks said. \\\"Just a real pro, a guy that comes to work each and every day. Phenomenal. Even 15 years in, what he practices is unbelievable. And a great role model for the young guys.\\\"\\n\\nHe is a role model for players beyond the Cardinals, as well. During the offseason, when Fitzgerald returns to the Twin Cities, he often works out with Vikings receiver Adam Thielen, a fellow Minnesota native.\\n\\nFitzgerald has twice led the NFL in receptions. Entering Sunday's game, Thielen is the league leader with 47 catches for 589 yards.\\n\\n\\\"I've learned a lot from Larry,\\\" said Thielen, a five-year veteran who made the Pro Bowl for the first time last season. \\\"Not just being personal with him, but watching him for a long time before I was even in the NFL. ... He's been just so great to me, reaching out to me and giving me support, and so it's been pretty cool. It's cool when guys that are at his status and have had success like he has still care about others and reach out to others.\\\"\\n\\nIt's not just his work on the field that has gained Fitzgerald respect. He has become a pillar in the Phoenix area for his work in the community. After the 2016 season, he shared the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award with New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\\n\\nHe established the Larry Fitzgerald First Down Fund, a charity that helps support Arizona youth. In Minnesota, he works with his father, Larry Fitzgerald Sr., a sports writer and broadcaster, on the Carol Fitzgerald Memorial Fund. The fund was established by his father after Fitzgerald's mother died of a brain hemorrhage in 2003 while being treated for breast cancer.\\n\\n\\\"I'm hoping that is still to come,\\\" Fitzgerald said when asked about his greatest achievement off the field. \\\"I like to believe the Lord put me on the earth for something much more important than catching a pigskin ball. The game has given me a wonderful platform, and it's helped me do some things I'm really proud of, some of the things that my parents taught me and showed me as a child, how important it is to serve others. And I'm hoping post-career I'm able to do that on a larger scale.\\\"\\n\\nMcCain a mentor, friend\\n\\nFitzgerald's most visible moment this year came outside of football. In August, he was chosen to deliver a eulogy at the funeral of Arizona Sen. John McCain.\\n\\nDespite a 47-year difference in their ages, Fitzgerald and McCain developed a close friendship.\\n\\n\\\"I'm very proud and appreciative of the relationship I had with him,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There were so many wonderful conversations and moments that I shared with him over the last years that I had known him. ... There are many differences between the two of us, from age, I played sports and he's a politician. There's no similarities there, but he took a liking to me, and I learned so much from him.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's interest away from sports has led him to become a world traveler. He has been to 100 countries, reaching that milestone with visits this year to Iceland and Sweden.\\n\\n\\\"I've always been proud of Larry the way he carries himself, the way he lights up a room,\\\" his father said. \\\"People gravitate to him. He's helped so many people through his foundation, my foundation. It's always been gratifying as a parent to be told by people who don't know your son that they are so proud of the way he carries himself.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald Sr., 61, was an offensive tackle at Indiana State from 1975-77, and says with pride that his son got much of his athleticism from him. Fitzgerald Sr., though, didn't realize how good his son was at football until he first began to play in 1993.\\n\\n\\\"When he was 10, my wife signed him up for a pee-wee football team at Dr. Martin Luther King Park in South Minneapolis,\\\" he father remembered. \\\"I started watching him and saw him make all these moves and stuff, and I'm saying, 'Man, he really can play.' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's abilities eventually took him to Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he was a two-time All-American, and to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was an All-American and Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2003. Fitzgerald was so good in high school that a number of Vikings players regularly attended his games.\\n\\nHe's a Vikings fan\\n\\nFitzgerald developed a relationship with Vikings players while serving as one of the team's ball boys from 1999-2001, his sophomore through senior seasons in high school. Fitzgerald got the job thanks to his father having started a radio show with Green in 1994, the third of his 10 years as coach.\\n\\n\\\"Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter, Randy Moss, Korey Stringer, they were all at (Fitzgerald's Holy Angels games),\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There would be 2,000 or 3,000 fans at the game and they would see the Vikings players and all be running up in the stands to get autographs.\\\"\\n\\nVikings players also provided valuable advice to Fitzgerald. He said their influence has played a role in his ability to have such a long career.\\n\\n\\\"I was able to see every day, I see Robert Smith, I see Cris Carter and I see Chris Walsh, Jake Reed, guys getting into the cold tub and working out and doing everything and getting massages and eating right and acupuncture and things like that that I've implemented in my career,\\\" Fitzgerald said.\\n\\nFitzgerald also became an avid Vikings fan, something that has continued ... most of the time.\\n\\n\\\"I pull for those guys every week except when I'm playing against them,\\\" he said. \\\"I still got a little purple running through my veins.\\\"\\n\\nIt hasn't gone well for the Cardinals in Fitzgerald's trips home. They are 0-5 in Minneapolis. Fitzgerald has had some big games in defeat, making 11 catches for 172 yards in 2006 and seven grabs for 107 yards in 2010.\\n\\nFitzgerald, though, has moved beyond his numbers. He said the reason he has continued to play is to get that elusive Super Bowl ring.\\n\\nIn Super Bowl XLIII, he came close. Fitzgerald scored on a 64-yard pass from Warner to give the Cardinals a 23-20 lead with 2:37 left in the game. But the Steelers won 27-23 when Ben Roethlisberger threw a 6-yard TD pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds remaining.\\n\\n\\\"I don't need any more catches or yards or touchdowns,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"I don't think any of that is going to change my place in history, but you know on a personal (level), you always want to win a championship. That's the only reason you play. ... You want to be a part of something special like winning a championship, and that's the reason I come back.\\\"\\n\\n'Favorite son'\\n\\nThe Cardinals, though, aren't looking like a contender this season. They are 1-4 and ranked last in the NFL in total offense.\\n\\nSam Bradford, who played the past two seasons for Minnesota, was the starting quarterback for the first three games before being replaced by rookie Josh Rosen. Both have struggled, and Fitzgerald has just 17 receptions for 176 yards coming off three straight 100-catch seasons.\\n\\n\\\"I think this is his last year in football,\\\" said Joe Theismann, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and NFL analyst. \\\"I think he'll move on to the next phase of his life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Theismann doesn't profess to have inside knowledge of Fitzgerald's plans, he is friendly with the wide receiver and has has played golf with him. Theismann was named NFL Man of the Year in 1982 with the Redskins, and said he has a book coming out that will include a reference to Fitzgerald's work ethic.\\n\\n\\\"When I was a broadcaster (for ESPN games during Fitzgerald's first three seasons), I wanted to interview him and I would stay and watch him after practice catching 50 or more balls,\\\" Thiesmann said. \\\"Larry Fitzgerald, to me, is the epitome of greatness on and off the field. I would call him the favorite son of the Minneapolis area.\\\"\\n\\nVikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who has gotten to know Fitzgerald, calls him the \\\"mayor of Phoenix.\\\"\\n\\nWhatever the title, Warner is proud of what Fitzgerald has accomplished and flattered that any advice he once provided helped.\\n\\n\\\"There are very few guys that have had the kind of legacy that Larry has had, being seen as an unbelievable person and an unbelievable player,\\\" Warner said. \\\"It's been an honor to become good friends with him and seeing the legacy he's going to leave.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:40:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Minneapolis\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"44.97997"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-93.26384"},"__v":0}

(AP) -- Purdue rolled over Illinois 46-7 on Saturday, dampening the Illini homecoming festivities and dimming their postseason hopes.\\n\\nIllinois (3-3, 1-2 Big Ten) arguably played its worst game of the year. Purdue (3-3, 2-1) scored 46 unanswered points after the first series. Illinois began the game scoring on a five-yard keeper by quarterback AJ Bush following a 52-yard pass to Reggie Corbin.\\n\\nPurdue racked up 611 yards in total offense compared to Illinois' 250. The Illini, which led the Big Ten in takeaways and ranked sixth in the nation in turnovers gained per game, forced its only turnover late in the third quarter when Cameron Watkins tipped a David Blough pass and it was intercepted by Sydney Brown. Illinois was unable to capitalize on the interception.\\n\\nPurdue sacked Bush four times and pressured him all game. D. J. Knox gained 150 yards rushing on 17 carries for the Boilermakers. Markell Jones had seven carries for 56 yards and a touchdown. Alexander Horvath also scored a touchdown.\\n\\nBush finished 12 of 25 for 170 yards passing and one interception. Bush also was the Illini's leading rusher, gaining 24 yards on 20 carries.\\n\\nBlough finished the day 25-of-36 passing for 377 yards and three touchdowns. He also caught a seven-yard touchdown pass on a reverse from wide receiver (and former quarterback) Jared Sparks. It was Sparks' first career touchdown pass.\\n\\nThe previously effective Illinois running game all but disappeared on Saturday.

Last year, Roux and fellow tech leader Corson \\\"Corky\\\" Ellis put forth a $300,000 grant to fund the Lewiston School Department's coding program, which was on full display last week at Montello.\\n\\nCOMPUTERS EVERYWHERE\\n\\nThe dozens of children who showed up for the school's Learn-to-Code night Wednesday had only the vaguest of idea of who Roux was. That fact didn't trouble him in the slightest.\\n\\n\\\"As you can see,\\\" Roux said, watching a drone zip across the gym, \\\"the real excitement is not old guys like us, but programming these things. I mean, how much fun is that?\\\"\\n\\nPlenty of fun, no doubt. The elementary-age kids at Montello seemed completely at ease with the technology - not just flying drones and making robots do their bidding, but learning how the software is coded. Roux watched all this with a kind of knowing satisfaction, seeing nothing but bright things in their futures.\\n\\n\\\"Anybody who starts coding here in third grade and sticks with it until they graduate, even if they choose not to go to college, they'll get a fantastic job,\\\" Roux said.\\n\\n\\\"They'll have multiple offers, great jobs and get paid a lot of money, because it's a valuable skill,\\\" he said. \\\"They're also going to be more likely to go to college. And if they go to college they're going to be more likely to study a STEM topic - science, technology, engineering or math. When they graduate, they're going to be more likely to go to grad school. They're going to be more likely to get a high-paying professional job. There's no downside.\\\"\\n\\nThe Learn-to-Code event Roux helped fund involved kids as old as eighth-graders and as young as kindergartners. Roux has no doubt they can handle the lessons.\\n\\n\\\"They don't think about it as computing or about programming as some horrible thing,\\\" he said. \\\"For us, what we're really doing is helping them to get to a more advanced stage.\\\"\\n\\nThe way Roux sees it, technology is not a bubble that's going to burst. By the time these Montello kids are grown up, it's going to be more prevalent and relevant than ever.\\n\\n\\\"What's coming next?\\\" he said. \\\"The easiest way to think about it is that we will no longer think about the devices. What's happening is that the computers are getting smaller and smaller.\\\"\\n\\nAs if on cue, a drone whips past.\\n\\n\\\"That has a computer in it,\\\" Roux said, pointing at it. \\\"That has a Wi-Fi network on it. That's how it's operated. It's generating its own Wi-Fi. Think of it as a flying antenna.\\\"\\n\\nAs computers get smaller and smaller, Roux continued, memory gets cheaper and cheaper.\\n\\n\\\"On the margin it means it doesn't cost anything to have a computer everywhere,\\\" he said. \\\"What you end up with is the approximate of free computing. Because it's small and cheap, it can be everywhere. Your belt will have a computer, your fridge will have a computer. It becomes completely ubiquitous. It kind of disappears. You're not actively thinking about it, it's just going to be everywhere.\\\"\\n\\nAt that, Roux was ushered out of the gym and led up the hall where children were using tablets to guide Cue, a fully programmable JavaScript robot with hundreds of different personalities just waiting to be released.\\n\\nNext he was off to a \\\"Programming with Angry Birds\\\" class, another on Lego robotics and a third on paper airplane algorithms. Nobody had to show Roux the way around the school. Back in the 1960s, he was a student in this very building, although back then it was a junior high school. His uncle, Joe Mahan, was the principal.\\n\\n'GROWING UP IN MAYBERRY'\\n\\nRoux graduated from Lewiston High School in 1974, at which point he went off to Harvard. He remembers Lewiston fondly. It's where his roots are.\\n\\n\\\"I often describe it as like growing up in Mayberry,\\\" he said. \\\"I grew up in a white, clapboard house on Main Street with a chestnut tree and a basketball court.\\\"\\n\\nHis mother, Connie Longley Roux, was a computer programmer with New England Telephone and sister to Maine Gov. James Longley. His father, Donald Roux, was a banker who coached high school sports and was chairman of the Lewiston school board.\\n\\n\\\"He was raised well by his family in Maine,\\\" said Silver Lake partner Jim Davidson, in an investor profile of Roux. \\\"He understands how fortunate he has been, so I think giving back is important to him.\\\"\\n\\nHis colleague describe him as quick-witted, quirky and intense. This is a man who has shaped billion-dollar companies and who likes to play bluegrass on the banjo in his down time.\\n\\nThese days, Roux lives on a 350-acre horse farm in northern Virginia where his wife, Barbara, breeds, trains and shows world-class jumpers. The couple has three adult children.\\n\\nIn his whirlwind tech career, Roux has been all over the place, yet his links to Maine are many. He and Barbara spend summers here at their home in Harpswell. Roux is also a trustee of Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, to which he and his wife recently donated $10 million to help search for cures for genetic-based diseases. In 2016, the couple presented a $10 million gift to Bowdoin College to support construction of a new Roux Center for the Environment.\\n\\n\\\"There's no shortage of worthy causes in the world,\\\" Roux said in an earlier interview. \\\"What it comes down to is we pick the ones that matter most. For me, it needs to be meaningful.\\\"\\n\\nLewiston, where Roux spent his entire childhood, is also important enough to him that he donated to its School Department, and drove around the city recently just for old time's sake.\\n\\n\\\"Some things have changed,\\\" he said, \\\"but you know? It is all extremely familiar.\\\"\\n\\nINFINITE POSSIBILITIES\\n\\nRoux and Corky Ellis, founder of Kepware Technologies and chairman of the board at Maine Venture Fund, were regarded as celebrities when they made their appearance at Montello on Wednesday night.\\n\\nIt's not just the grant money, although the funds were instrumental in getting the coding program off the ground. The men have a kind of aura about them, the kind of aura people sense in those who have turned their passions into big money.\\n\\nAnd while technology has been a main ingredient in Roux's success, it isn't the only ingredient. A keen understanding of economics and global markets contributed to his achievements. Much of what Roux does is pure business -- dollars and cents rather than bits and bytes. And that business sense is something that appealed to Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster when he was approached by Ellis about starting a coding program for Lewiston schools.\\n\\n\\\"I'm a businessman by background,\\\" Webster said. \\\"Corky and Dave are businessmen. And as businessmen, you don't spend two or three years studying it from an academic perspective. You experiment. You try something. And so, we went right to doing something.\\\"\\n\\nIt's too soon to say how successful the program will be, although the buzz of activity at Montello last week was a sign that Roux's optimism may be well-founded.\\n\\n\\\"We're going to give 50 percent of our students a coding experience this year,\\\" Webster said. \\\"It's amazing to think that this is something that didn't exist a year ago.\\\"\\n\\nWith that in mind, Roux on Wednesday bent down to watch as kids looked over the coding behind the beloved video game Angry Birds. He watched them steer Cue in one part of the school and dodged a paper airplane in another.\\n\\nHe's optimistic that given some years and training, some of the children goofing around with Legos and paper airplanes today will be leaders of technology tomorrow. The joy, he said, is wondering where technology will take them -- and where they will take technology.\\n\\n\\\"Back when we had big, clunky computers, we just couldn't imagine we could ever get them small enough or with a battery powerful enough,\\\" Roux said. \\\"Part of the fun is that you don't know what's going to happen.\\\"\\n\\nfiled under: lewiston maine Related Stories Latest Articles Local \u0026 State Tech investor gives back to next generation Sports Saturday's high school roundup: Cheverus advances with OT win in field hockey News Car falls on woman in Oxford County Sports Pastrnak records hat trick as Bruins storm past Red Wings College Maine college football roundup: Husson rolls to third straight win Want the news vital to Maine?

Purdue (3-3, 2-1) scored 46 unanswered points after the first series. Illinois began the game scoring on a five-yard keeper by quarterback AJ Bush following a 52-yard pass to Reggie Corbin.\\n\\nPurdue racked up 611 yards in total offense compared to Illinois' 250.

Illinois was unable to capitalize on the interception.\\n\\nPurdue sacked Bush four times and pressured him all game. D. J. Knox gained 150 yards rushing on 17 carries for the Boilermakers. Markell Jones had seven carries for 56 yards and a touchdown. Alexander Horvath also scored a touchdown.\\n\\nBush finished 12 of 25 for 170 yards passing and one interception.

They weren't at their best and Pittsburgh played well. We still found a way.\\\"\\n\\nPitt led 14-12 thanks to a long first-quarter touchdown drive and a 99-yard kickoff return by Maurice Ffrench to start the second half.\\n\\nPat Narduzzi's Panthers were looking to upset an Associated Press top-five team for the third straight season after knocking off No. 3 Clemson in Death Valley during the 2016 season and No. 2 Miami last November in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nBut the Irish, who were held to 80 yards rushing, prevailed behind Book, who is 4-0 as a starter since replacing Brandon Wimbush.\\n\\nBook was intercepted twice, but finished with 264 yards passing. He was 13 of 14 for 158 yards in the second half. Boykin had four receptions for 84 yards in the game.\\n\\n\\\"I feel bad for our kids in the locker room,\\\" Narduzzi said. \\\"I'm disappointed for them. They fought their tails off. We were ahead almost the entire game. Sometimes you can't control what you can't control. We went toe-to-toe with a top-five team and we didn't pull it off in the end.\\\"\\n\\nBook and Boykin have connected for memorable plays before, including the 55-yard winning touchdown with 1:28 remaining in Notre Dame's 21-17 victory over LSU at the Citrus Bowl last season.\\n\\nPitt senior running tandem of Darrin Hall and Qadree Ollison rushed for 62 and 50 yards, respectively, with Ollison scoring the Panthers' first touchdown on a 9-yard run that capped a 17-play drive on their first possession of the game.\\n\\nKenny Pickett was 19 for 28 for 126 yards, and was sacked by Khalid Kareem - Notre Dame's only sack of the game - for a loss of 14 yards on Pitt's final possession to set up a fourth-and-long the Panthers could not convert.\\n\\nPitt also ran a strange faked punt on its second-to-last drive around midfield that failed.\\n\\nTAKEAWAYS\\n\\nPittsburgh: The Panthers gained just 12 yards on their last three drives of the first half. Their first, however, was a thing of beauty: 17 plays, 88 yards, six first downs, consuming 9:43 of the clock and ending with Ollison taking a direct snap, faking an end-around handoff and running into the end zone on second-and-goal from the Irish 9.\\n\\nNotre Dame: The Irish trailed for the first times after the first quarter (7-0), at halftime (7-6) and after three quarters (14-12), and they were their own worst enemy with turnovers, quarterback sacks and penalties at inopportune times. On Pitt's opening touchdown drive, the Panthers dropped back to punt on fourth-and-4 at their own 29, but Notre Dame jumped offside, giving the Panthers a first down that kept their drive alive.\\n\\nUPSET PANTHERS\\n\\nThis is the 11th time in the last 12 games between the two teams that the winning margin was in single digits. The Panthers won 28-21 in 2013 and 27-22 in 2009, both at home. Pitt last win at Notre Dame Stadium was a 36-33 four-overtime affair in 2008.\\n\\nThe Irish also prevailed at home 29-26 in triple overtime in 2012 in a game in which the Panthers missed a possible game-winning field goal in the second extra period.\\n\\nANEMIC IRISH\\n\\nNotre Dame, which entered the game averaging 195.7 yards (47th nationally), took a hit as Pittsburgh's front four held the Irish to just 80 yards on 38 carries.

I did expect to make more starts for us in this year's playoffs.

He does a lot for that offense. And then [George] Springer sets the tone really well. Those two guys,\\\" said Price. \\\"And I mean, obviously you can't look over anybody in their lineup -- [Jose] Altuve obviously, he's last year's MVP; [Carlos] Correa. They've got a very powerful lineup and you've got to focus on all nine.\\\"\\n\\n* Shop Red Sox postseason gear\\n\\nPrice isn't worried about rust, even though he's pitched just 1 2/3 innings since Sept. 27.

So I don't think I'll be rusty.\\\"\\n\\nThough Price has been impacted by circulation issues in his hands at times this season, he's not worried about the October chill that will be present at Fenway on Sunday.

I felt like the matchup for Raffy to start the game wasn't a good one,\\\" Cora said. \\\"He matches up well against their bullpen.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc282ed54bb9c37288d3e78"},"title":"\"Larry Fitzgerald brings lasting legacy to what looks like his...\"","body":"\"MINNEAPOLIS -- In January 2010, Kurt Warner was on an airplane with Larry Fitzgerald when the veteran quarterback informed his top receiver he would be retiring from the NFL.\\n\\nWarner and Fitzgerald played together for five seasons with the Arizona Cardinals and helped lead the franchise to its only Super Bowl, a last-minute loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009.\\n\\nWhen Warner finished telling Fitzgerald his plans, the receiver had some news for him. In 2005, when Warner joined the Cardinals, the quarterback told Fitzgerald he wasn't working hard enough and needed to commit himself more to become great.\\n\\n\\\"Five years later, he told me, 'I'll never forget that conversation that you had with me,' \\\" Warner said. \\\"He said it motivated him from that moment on like, 'Why don't I want to be the best?' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald, a Minneapolis native and former local prep star, developed into one of the top receivers in NFL history. In his 15th season, he ranks among the best receivers of all time: third in receptions (1,251), third in receiving yards (15,721) and eighth in receiving touchdowns (110).\\n\\nOn Sunday, Oct. 14, Fitzgerald, 35, will make what could be the final appearance of his career in his hometown when the Cardinals (1-4) face the Vikings (2-2-1) at U.S. Bank Stadium. Many believe this will be his final NFL season.\\n\\nFitzgerald, a Vikings ball boy during the Dennis Green era, said he won't decide on his future until after the season. He did reflect, though, on his illustrious NFL career.\\n\\nAfter being taken by the Cardinals with the No. 3 pick in the 2004 draft, Fitzgerald had a good-but-not-great rookie season, catching 58 passes for 780 yards. A year later, Warner, who led the St. Louis Rams to two Super Bowls, including a victory in January 2000, arrived in Arizona.\\n\\nAfter watching the cocky young receiver in practice, Warner told him he had better wide receivers with the Rams in Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt.\\n\\n\\\"You could see the upside of this kid, but at the same time you could also see that he didn't necessarily understand how to play the game, like the little nuances of being a great route runner,\\\" said Warner, who was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and is now an NFL Network analyst. \\\"So we were at dinner and I shared that with him, and his response was kind of like, 'I'm pretty good. I'm good enough right now. We've got bigger problems in Arizona than me.' \\\"\\n\\nBest friends now\\n\\nSlowly, Warner's words sank in, and Fitzgerald eventually took that advice to heart. He improved quickly, and led the NFL in receiving in 2005 with 103 catches for 1,409 yards, securing a spot in the first of his 11 Pro Bowls.\\n\\n\\\"I was like most 21-year-olds,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"You just think your stuff doesn't stink and (Warner) served me a small splash of the humble pie, which I needed. I didn't take it personally. I just took it as a challenge. ... I was very grateful that he came along in my life, my career, at the time. I really needed that leadership and that challenge to take my game to the next level.\\\"\\n\\nWarner said he and Fitzgerald eventually became best friends, and said it's been an \\\"honor to see him grow into the person he's become.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald has gone from a cocky kid to a wise NFL veteran. First-year Cardinals coach Steve Wilks was impressed immediately with Fitzgerald's leadership abilities.\\n\\n\\\"Everything you see that's advertised is totally true,\\\" Wilks said. \\\"Just a real pro, a guy that comes to work each and every day. Phenomenal. Even 15 years in, what he practices is unbelievable. And a great role model for the young guys.\\\"\\n\\nHe is a role model for players beyond the Cardinals, as well. During the offseason, when Fitzgerald returns to the Twin Cities, he often works out with Vikings receiver Adam Thielen, a fellow Minnesota native.\\n\\nFitzgerald has twice led the NFL in receptions. Entering Sunday's game, Thielen is the league leader with 47 catches for 589 yards.\\n\\n\\\"I've learned a lot from Larry,\\\" said Thielen, a five-year veteran who made the Pro Bowl for the first time last season. \\\"Not just being personal with him, but watching him for a long time before I was even in the NFL. ... He's been just so great to me, reaching out to me and giving me support, and so it's been pretty cool. It's cool when guys that are at his status and have had success like he has still care about others and reach out to others.\\\"\\n\\nIt's not just his work on the field that has gained Fitzgerald respect. He has become a pillar in the Phoenix area for his work in the community. After the 2016 season, he shared the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award with New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\\n\\nHe established the Larry Fitzgerald First Down Fund, a charity that helps support Arizona youth. In Minnesota, he works with his father, Larry Fitzgerald Sr., a sports writer and broadcaster, on the Carol Fitzgerald Memorial Fund. The fund was established by his father after Fitzgerald's mother died of a brain hemorrhage in 2003 while being treated for breast cancer.\\n\\n\\\"I'm hoping that is still to come,\\\" Fitzgerald said when asked about his greatest achievement off the field. \\\"I like to believe the Lord put me on the earth for something much more important than catching a pigskin ball. The game has given me a wonderful platform, and it's helped me do some things I'm really proud of, some of the things that my parents taught me and showed me as a child, how important it is to serve others. And I'm hoping post-career I'm able to do that on a larger scale.\\\"\\n\\nMcCain a mentor, friend\\n\\nFitzgerald's most visible moment this year came outside of football. In August, he was chosen to deliver a eulogy at the funeral of Arizona Sen. John McCain.\\n\\nDespite a 47-year difference in their ages, Fitzgerald and McCain developed a close friendship.\\n\\n\\\"I'm very proud and appreciative of the relationship I had with him,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There were so many wonderful conversations and moments that I shared with him over the last years that I had known him. ... There are many differences between the two of us, from age, I played sports and he's a politician. There's no similarities there, but he took a liking to me, and I learned so much from him.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's interest away from sports has led him to become a world traveler. He has been to 100 countries, reaching that milestone with visits this year to Iceland and Sweden.\\n\\n\\\"I've always been proud of Larry the way he carries himself, the way he lights up a room,\\\" his father said. \\\"People gravitate to him. He's helped so many people through his foundation, my foundation. It's always been gratifying as a parent to be told by people who don't know your son that they are so proud of the way he carries himself.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald Sr., 61, was an offensive tackle at Indiana State from 1975-77, and says with pride that his son got much of his athleticism from him. Fitzgerald Sr., though, didn't realize how good his son was at football until he first began to play in 1993.\\n\\n\\\"When he was 10, my wife signed him up for a pee-wee football team at Dr. Martin Luther King Park in South Minneapolis,\\\" he father remembered. \\\"I started watching him and saw him make all these moves and stuff, and I'm saying, 'Man, he really can play.' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's abilities eventually took him to Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he was a two-time All-American, and to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was an All-American and Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2003. Fitzgerald was so good in high school that a number of Vikings players regularly attended his games.\\n\\nHe's a Vikings fan\\n\\nFitzgerald developed a relationship with Vikings players while serving as one of the team's ball boys from 1999-2001, his sophomore through senior seasons in high school. Fitzgerald got the job thanks to his father having started a radio show with Green in 1994, the third of his 10 years as coach.\\n\\n\\\"Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter, Randy Moss, Korey Stringer, they were all at (Fitzgerald's Holy Angels games),\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There would be 2,000 or 3,000 fans at the game and they would see the Vikings players and all be running up in the stands to get autographs.\\\"\\n\\nVikings players also provided valuable advice to Fitzgerald. He said their influence has played a role in his ability to have such a long career.\\n\\n\\\"I was able to see every day, I see Robert Smith, I see Cris Carter and I see Chris Walsh, Jake Reed, guys getting into the cold tub and working out and doing everything and getting massages and eating right and acupuncture and things like that that I've implemented in my career,\\\" Fitzgerald said.\\n\\nFitzgerald also became an avid Vikings fan, something that has continued ... most of the time.\\n\\n\\\"I pull for those guys every week except when I'm playing against them,\\\" he said. \\\"I still got a little purple running through my veins.\\\"\\n\\nIt hasn't gone well for the Cardinals in Fitzgerald's trips home. They are 0-5 in Minneapolis. Fitzgerald has had some big games in defeat, making 11 catches for 172 yards in 2006 and seven grabs for 107 yards in 2010.\\n\\nFitzgerald, though, has moved beyond his numbers. He said the reason he has continued to play is to get that elusive Super Bowl ring.\\n\\nIn Super Bowl XLIII, he came close. Fitzgerald scored on a 64-yard pass from Warner to give the Cardinals a 23-20 lead with 2:37 left in the game. But the Steelers won 27-23 when Ben Roethlisberger threw a 6-yard TD pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds remaining.\\n\\n\\\"I don't need any more catches or yards or touchdowns,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"I don't think any of that is going to change my place in history, but you know on a personal (level), you always want to win a championship. That's the only reason you play. ... You want to be a part of something special like winning a championship, and that's the reason I come back.\\\"\\n\\n'Favorite son'\\n\\nThe Cardinals, though, aren't looking like a contender this season. They are 1-4 and ranked last in the NFL in total offense.\\n\\nSam Bradford, who played the past two seasons for Minnesota, was the starting quarterback for the first three games before being replaced by rookie Josh Rosen. Both have struggled, and Fitzgerald has just 17 receptions for 176 yards coming off three straight 100-catch seasons.\\n\\n\\\"I think this is his last year in football,\\\" said Joe Theismann, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and NFL analyst. \\\"I think he'll move on to the next phase of his life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Theismann doesn't profess to have inside knowledge of Fitzgerald's plans, he is friendly with the wide receiver and has has played golf with him. Theismann was named NFL Man of the Year in 1982 with the Redskins, and said he has a book coming out that will include a reference to Fitzgerald's work ethic.\\n\\n\\\"When I was a broadcaster (for ESPN games during Fitzgerald's first three seasons), I wanted to interview him and I would stay and watch him after practice catching 50 or more balls,\\\" Thiesmann said. \\\"Larry Fitzgerald, to me, is the epitome of greatness on and off the field. I would call him the favorite son of the Minneapolis area.\\\"\\n\\nVikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who has gotten to know Fitzgerald, calls him the \\\"mayor of Phoenix.\\\"\\n\\nWhatever the title, Warner is proud of what Fitzgerald has accomplished and flattered that any advice he once provided helped.\\n\\n\\\"There are very few guys that have had the kind of legacy that Larry has had, being seen as an unbelievable person and an unbelievable player,\\\" Warner said. \\\"It's been an honor to become good friends with him and seeing the legacy he's going to leave.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:33:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Minneapolis\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"44.97997"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-93.26384"},"__v":0}

He has fit right into that four or five spot his three years with us,\\\" Lehman said. \\\"Kaleb goes from a six-man his sophomore year, moved his way to five and flip-flopped back and forth. Those two have done the job that needs to be done in the four, five, six position.\\n\\n\\\"Jack came in as a freshman in a weaker season, record-wise, and went right to the one spot and was under a lot of pressure because the seniors were ticked off at the time. He has had some incredible rounds his entire career, he has been in the 30's since his sophomore year.\\\"\\n\\nHarsh made his first appearance at the state tournament after being an alternate last year and said, \\\"It's a lot more exciting than watching, that's for sure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't play as well as I would've liked to, but it's a tough course and I knew if I threw it away, there could've been something crazy like districts,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThose three, especially McElligott, can be credited with where the program currently is.\\n\\n\\\"This whole thing started with Jack playing well his freshman year, it trickled down to McMullen and Keller on the junior high team, now they get to varsity last year and play lights out as freshmen,\\\" Lehman said. \\\"I am beyond blessed to have the kids that put the time in.\\\"\\n\\nFor the two sophomores, Keller said it was a great experience overall and will only benefit them with two years still left to play. McMullen shared a similar sentiment.\\n\\n\\\"Even if you play a bad round, it's so fun to be here, the environment with all the spectators, your name is on the big board and you're playing with really good players,\\\" McMullen said.\\n\\nWith Saturday being the final competitive round the team played together, both sophomores said it's going to be sad not teeing off with the seniors again.\\n\\n\\\"We're so close to all of them, I can't even explain it,\\\" Keller said.\\n\\n\\\"They're like my best friends,\\\" McMullen added. \\\"Freshman year they all took me under their wing, drove me to practice every day, we golfed every day.

In 2005, when Warner joined the Cardinals, the quarterback told Fitzgerald he wasn't working hard enough and needed to commit himself more to become great.\\n\\n\\\"Five years later, he told me, 'I'll never forget that conversation that you had with me,' \\\" Warner said. \\\"He said it motivated him from that moment on like, 'Why don't I want to be the best?' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald, a Minneapolis native and former local prep star, developed into one of the top receivers in NFL history. In his 15th season, he ranks among the best receivers of all time: third in receptions (1,251), third in receiving yards (15,721) and eighth in receiving touchdowns (110).\\n\\nOn Sunday, Oct. 14, Fitzgerald, 35, will make what could be the final appearance of his career in his hometown when the Cardinals (1-4) face the Vikings (2-2-1) at U.S. Bank Stadium. Many believe this will be his final NFL season.\\n\\nFitzgerald, a Vikings ball boy during the Dennis Green era, said he won't decide on his future until after the season. He did reflect, though, on his illustrious NFL career.\\n\\nAfter being taken by the Cardinals with the No. 3 pick in the 2004 draft, Fitzgerald had a good-but-not-great rookie season, catching 58 passes for 780 yards. A year later, Warner, who led the St. Louis Rams to two Super Bowls, including a victory in January 2000, arrived in Arizona.\\n\\nAfter watching the cocky young receiver in practice, Warner told him he had better wide receivers with the Rams in Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt.\\n\\n\\\"You could see the upside of this kid, but at the same time you could also see that he didn't necessarily understand how to play the game, like the little nuances of being a great route runner,\\\" said Warner, who was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and is now an NFL Network analyst. \\\"So we were at dinner and I shared that with him, and his response was kind of like, 'I'm pretty good. I'm good enough right now. We've got bigger problems in Arizona than me.' \\\"\\n\\nBest friends now\\n\\nSlowly, Warner's words sank in, and Fitzgerald eventually took that advice to heart. He improved quickly, and led the NFL in receiving in 2005 with 103 catches for 1,409 yards, securing a spot in the first of his 11 Pro Bowls.\\n\\n\\\"I was like most 21-year-olds,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"You just think your stuff doesn't stink and (Warner) served me a small splash of the humble pie, which I needed. I didn't take it personally. I just took it as a challenge. ... I was very grateful that he came along in my life, my career, at the time. I really needed that leadership and that challenge to take my game to the next level.\\\"\\n\\nWarner said he and Fitzgerald eventually became best friends, and said it's been an \\\"honor to see him grow into the person he's become.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald has gone from a cocky kid to a wise NFL veteran. First-year Cardinals coach Steve Wilks was impressed immediately with Fitzgerald's leadership abilities.\\n\\n\\\"Everything you see that's advertised is totally true,\\\" Wilks said. \\\"Just a real pro, a guy that comes to work each and every day. Phenomenal. Even 15 years in, what he practices is unbelievable. And a great role model for the young guys.\\\"\\n\\nHe is a role model for players beyond the Cardinals, as well. During the offseason, when Fitzgerald returns to the Twin Cities, he often works out with Vikings receiver Adam Thielen, a fellow Minnesota native.\\n\\nFitzgerald has twice led the NFL in receptions. Entering Sunday's game, Thielen is the league leader with 47 catches for 589 yards.\\n\\n\\\"I've learned a lot from Larry,\\\" said Thielen, a five-year veteran who made the Pro Bowl for the first time last season. \\\"Not just being personal with him, but watching him for a long time before I was even in the NFL. ... He's been just so great to me, reaching out to me and giving me support, and so it's been pretty cool. It's cool when guys that are at his status and have had success like he has still care about others and reach out to others.\\\"\\n\\nIt's not just his work on the field that has gained Fitzgerald respect. He has become a pillar in the Phoenix area for his work in the community. After the 2016 season, he shared the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award with New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\\n\\nHe established the Larry Fitzgerald First Down Fund, a charity that helps support Arizona youth. In Minnesota, he works with his father, Larry Fitzgerald Sr., a sports writer and broadcaster, on the Carol Fitzgerald Memorial Fund. The fund was established by his father after Fitzgerald's mother died of a brain hemorrhage in 2003 while being treated for breast cancer.\\n\\n\\\"I'm hoping that is still to come,\\\" Fitzgerald said when asked about his greatest achievement off the field. \\\"I like to believe the Lord put me on the earth for something much more important than catching a pigskin ball. The game has given me a wonderful platform, and it's helped me do some things I'm really proud of, some of the things that my parents taught me and showed me as a child, how important it is to serve others. And I'm hoping post-career I'm able to do that on a larger scale.\\\"\\n\\nMcCain a mentor, friend\\n\\nFitzgerald's most visible moment this year came outside of football. In August, he was chosen to deliver a eulogy at the funeral of Arizona Sen. John McCain.\\n\\nDespite a 47-year difference in their ages, Fitzgerald and McCain developed a close friendship.\\n\\n\\\"I'm very proud and appreciative of the relationship I had with him,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There were so many wonderful conversations and moments that I shared with him over the last years that I had known him. ... There are many differences between the two of us, from age, I played sports and he's a politician. There's no similarities there, but he took a liking to me, and I learned so much from him.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's interest away from sports has led him to become a world traveler. He has been to 100 countries, reaching that milestone with visits this year to Iceland and Sweden.\\n\\n\\\"I've always been proud of Larry the way he carries himself, the way he lights up a room,\\\" his father said. \\\"People gravitate to him. He's helped so many people through his foundation, my foundation. It's always been gratifying as a parent to be told by people who don't know your son that they are so proud of the way he carries himself.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald Sr., 61, was an offensive tackle at Indiana State from 1975-77, and says with pride that his son got much of his athleticism from him. Fitzgerald Sr., though, didn't realize how good his son was at football until he first began to play in 1993.\\n\\n\\\"When he was 10, my wife signed him up for a pee-wee football team at Dr. Martin Luther King Park in South Minneapolis,\\\" he father remembered. \\\"I started watching him and saw him make all these moves and stuff, and I'm saying, 'Man, he really can play.' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's abilities eventually took him to Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he was a two-time All-American, and to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was an All-American and Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2003. Fitzgerald was so good in high school that a number of Vikings players regularly attended his games.\\n\\nHe's a Vikings fan\\n\\nFitzgerald developed a relationship with Vikings players while serving as one of the team's ball boys from 1999-2001, his sophomore through senior seasons in high school. Fitzgerald got the job thanks to his father having started a radio show with Green in 1994, the third of his 10 years as coach.\\n\\n\\\"Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter, Randy Moss, Korey Stringer, they were all at (Fitzgerald's Holy Angels games),\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There would be 2,000 or 3,000 fans at the game and they would see the Vikings players and all be running up in the stands to get autographs.\\\"\\n\\nVikings players also provided valuable advice to Fitzgerald. He said their influence has played a role in his ability to have such a long career.\\n\\n\\\"I was able to see every day, I see Robert Smith, I see Cris Carter and I see Chris Walsh, Jake Reed, guys getting into the cold tub and working out and doing everything and getting massages and eating right and acupuncture and things like that that I've implemented in my career,\\\" Fitzgerald said.\\n\\nFitzgerald also became an avid Vikings fan, something that has continued ... most of the time.\\n\\n\\\"I pull for those guys every week except when I'm playing against them,\\\" he said. \\\"I still got a little purple running through my veins.\\\"\\n\\nIt hasn't gone well for the Cardinals in Fitzgerald's trips home. They are 0-5 in Minneapolis. Fitzgerald has had some big games in defeat, making 11 catches for 172 yards in 2006 and seven grabs for 107 yards in 2010.\\n\\nFitzgerald, though, has moved beyond his numbers. He said the reason he has continued to play is to get that elusive Super Bowl ring.\\n\\nIn Super Bowl XLIII, he came close. Fitzgerald scored on a 64-yard pass from Warner to give the Cardinals a 23-20 lead with 2:37 left in the game. But the Steelers won 27-23 when Ben Roethlisberger threw a 6-yard TD pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds remaining.\\n\\n\\\"I don't need any more catches or yards or touchdowns,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"I don't think any of that is going to change my place in history, but you know on a personal (level), you always want to win a championship. That's the only reason you play. ... You want to be a part of something special like winning a championship, and that's the reason I come back.\\\"\\n\\n'Favorite son'\\n\\nThe Cardinals, though, aren't looking like a contender this season. They are 1-4 and ranked last in the NFL in total offense.\\n\\nSam Bradford, who played the past two seasons for Minnesota, was the starting quarterback for the first three games before being replaced by rookie Josh Rosen. Both have struggled, and Fitzgerald has just 17 receptions for 176 yards coming off three straight 100-catch seasons.\\n\\n\\\"I think this is his last year in football,\\\" said Joe Theismann, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and NFL analyst. \\\"I think he'll move on to the next phase of his life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Theismann doesn't profess to have inside knowledge of Fitzgerald's plans, he is friendly with the wide receiver and has has played golf with him. Theismann was named NFL Man of the Year in 1982 with the Redskins, and said he has a book coming out that will include a reference to Fitzgerald's work ethic.\\n\\n\\\"When I was a broadcaster (for ESPN games during Fitzgerald's first three seasons), I wanted to interview him and I would stay and watch him after practice catching 50 or more balls,\\\" Thiesmann said. \\\"Larry Fitzgerald, to me, is the epitome of greatness on and off the field. I would call him the favorite son of the Minneapolis area.\\\"\\n\\nVikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who has gotten to know Fitzgerald, calls him the \\\"mayor of Phoenix.\\\"\\n\\nWhatever the title, Warner is proud of what Fitzgerald has accomplished and flattered that any advice he once provided helped.\\n\\n\\\"There are very few guys that have had the kind of legacy that Larry has had, being seen as an unbelievable person and an unbelievable player,\\\" Warner said. \\\"It's been an honor to become good friends with him and seeing the legacy he's going to leave.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:30:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Minneapolis\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"44.97997"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-93.26384"},"__v":0}

For much of the past two decades, the trend had been one side dominating the other -- with the Ducks winning 12 in a row, then the Huskies winning the last two by a combined score of 108-24. Finally, we had a four-quarter ballgame (and then some) -- and it was a mighty good one. Washington, playing without star running back Myles Gaskin (shoulder) got the ball back with 5:05 left at its own 7-yard line with the score tied 24-24. Jake Browning then directed the Huskies on one of the most impressive fourth-quarter drives of his career, the biggest play a 4-yard completion to running back Sean McGrew on fourth-and-3 with less than a minute to play. That helped set up a 37-yard field-goal attempt for UW redshirt freshman Peyton Henry, but after being iced twice on Oregon timeouts Henry's attempt sailed wide right as time expired. In overtime, Browning's third-down pass intended for Ty Jones was too high in the right corner of the end zone, forcing the Huskies had to settle for 21-yard field goal from Henry. That gave Washington a 27-24 lead, but Oregon came back with its overtime possession and won it on CJ Verdell's 5-yard touchdown run.\\n\\nWith the score tied 24-24 midway through the fourth quarter, a targeting call against Washington senior defensive lineman Jaylen Johnson gave Oregon a first down at the UW 37-yard line. The Ducks then got to the UW 27-yard line before the Huskies defense showed up with back-to-back big plays. First, it was a tackle for loss from junior safety Taylor Rapp on a QB run from Justin Herbert. Tevis Bartlett then got to Herbert for a sack and a loss of 5 yards, pushing Oregon out of field-goal range. Herbert followed with an incomplete pass, forcing Oregon to punt the ball back to the Huskies with 5 minutes left.\\n\\nThe Huskies turned to third- and fourth-string running backs Sean McGrew and Kamari Pleasant for key stretches in the second half and overtime after injuries to senior Myles Gaskin (shoulder) and sophomore Salvon Ahmed (leg). Both Gaskin and Ahmed return to the field but were limited. There was no immediate word on the severity of their injuries. McGrew came up big on the Huskies' final drive of the fourth quarter, then Pleasant got the call in overtime, opening the extra session with a 19-yard run.

Fitzgerald Sr., though, didn't realize how good his son was at football until he first began to play in 1993.\\n\\n\\\"When he was 10, my wife signed him up for a pee-wee football team at Dr. Martin Luther King Park in South Minneapolis,\\\" he father remembered. \\\"I started watching him and saw him make all these moves and stuff, and I'm saying, 'Man, he really can play.' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's abilities eventually took him to Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he was a two-time All-American, and to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was an All-American and Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2003. Fitzgerald was so good in high school that a number of Vikings players regularly attended his games.\\n\\nHe's a Vikings fan\\n\\nFitzgerald developed a relationship with Vikings players while serving as one of the team's ball boys from 1999-2001, his sophomore through senior seasons in high school. Fitzgerald got the job thanks to his father having started a radio show with Green in 1994, the third of his 10 years as coach.\\n\\n\\\"Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter, Randy Moss, Korey Stringer, they were all at (Fitzgerald's Holy Angels games),\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There would be 2,000 or 3,000 fans at the game and they would see the Vikings players and all be running up in the stands to get autographs.\\\"\\n\\nVikings players also provided valuable advice to Fitzgerald. He said their influence has played a role in his ability to have such a long career.\\n\\n\\\"I was able to see every day, I see Robert Smith, I see Cris Carter and I see Chris Walsh, Jake Reed, guys getting into the cold tub and working out and doing everything and getting massages and eating right and acupuncture and things like that that I've implemented in my career,\\\" Fitzgerald said.\\n\\nFitzgerald also became an avid Vikings fan, something that has continued ... most of the time.\\n\\n\\\"I pull for those guys every week except when I'm playing against them,\\\" he said. \\\"I still got a little purple running through my veins.\\\"\\n\\nIt hasn't gone well for the Cardinals in Fitzgerald's trips home. They are 0-5 in Minneapolis. Fitzgerald has had some big games in defeat, making 11 catches for 172 yards in 2006 and seven grabs for 107 yards in 2010.\\n\\nFitzgerald, though, has moved beyond his numbers. He said the reason he has continued to play is to get that elusive Super Bowl ring.\\n\\nIn Super Bowl XLIII, he came close. Fitzgerald scored on a 64-yard pass from Warner to give the Cardinals a 23-20 lead with 2:37 left in the game. But the Steelers won 27-23 when Ben Roethlisberger threw a 6-yard TD pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds remaining.\\n\\n\\\"I don't need any more catches or yards or touchdowns,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"I don't think any of that is going to change my place in history, but you know on a personal (level), you always want to win a championship. That's the only reason you play. ... You want to be a part of something special like winning a championship, and that's the reason I come back.\\\"\\n\\n'Favorite son'\\n\\nThe Cardinals, though, aren't looking like a contender this season. They are 1-4 and ranked last in the NFL in total offense.\\n\\nSam Bradford, who played the past two seasons for Minnesota, was the starting quarterback for the first three games before being replaced by rookie Josh Rosen. Both have struggled, and Fitzgerald has just 17 receptions for 176 yards coming off three straight 100-catch seasons.\\n\\n\\\"I think this is his last year in football,\\\" said Joe Theismann, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and NFL analyst. \\\"I think he'll move on to the next phase of his life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Theismann doesn't profess to have inside knowledge of Fitzgerald's plans, he is friendly with the wide receiver and has has played golf with him. Theismann was named NFL Man of the Year in 1982 with the Redskins, and said he has a book coming out that will include a reference to Fitzgerald's work ethic.\\n\\n\\\"When I was a broadcaster (for ESPN games during Fitzgerald's first three seasons), I wanted to interview him and I would stay and watch him after practice catching 50 or more balls,\\\" Thiesmann said. \\\"Larry Fitzgerald, to me, is the epitome of greatness on and off the field. I would call him the favorite son of the Minneapolis area.\\\"\\n\\nVikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who has gotten to know Fitzgerald, calls him the \\\"mayor of Phoenix.\\\"\\n\\nWhatever the title, Warner is proud of what Fitzgerald has accomplished and flattered that any advice he once provided helped.\\n\\n\\\"There are very few guys that have had the kind of legacy that Larry has had, being seen as an unbelievable person and an unbelievable player,\\\" Warner said. \\\"It's been an honor to become good friends with him and seeing the legacy he's going to leave.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:27:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Minneapolis\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"44.97997"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-93.26384"},"__v":0}

The public has until the close of Monday to comment on the proposal.\\n\\nMore than 7,600 comments have been submitted so far, the vast majority in opposition, including many who consider it an effort by the Trump administration to deter some of the major protests that have marked his presidency.\\n\\n\\\"Requiring these burdensome fees will dissuade Americans from demonstrating,\\\" wrote Gayle Copeland of San Antonio, Texas. \\\"This new rule is not reflective of American values or history to peacefully protest.\\\"\\n\\nThe National Park Service issues about 750 permits a year for demonstrations within the National Mall and at nearby parks. The agency said its proposed rule is designed to provide greater clarity about how and where demonstration can occur in a manner that protects historically important public land.\\n\\nThere have been several large demonstrations on or near the National Mall since President Donald Trump assumed office. The Women's March in January 2017 brought protesters from throughout the country to Washington, and that has been followed by protests of the president's actions on climate change and guns, to name a few.\\n\\nNational Park Service Spokesman Brent Everitt said the agency will always support the First Amendment right of free speech and assembly. But citing an event preceding the Trump presidency, he noted that the cost of providing law enforcement and other support services for Occupy DC in 2012 came to about $480,000. The protesters sought to bring attention to social and economic inequality in the wake of the financial crisis and set up a makeshift tent camp that raised health concerns.\\n\\n\\\"We want to know the public's views on whether this is an appropriate expenditure of National Park Service funds, or whether we should also attempt to recover costs for supporting these kinds of events if the group seeking the permit for the event has the ability to cover those costs,\\\" Everitt said.\\n\\nEveritt said the National Park Service is not recommending charging a fee for demonstrations, but raising the question of whether it should.\\n\\nThe ACLU's chapter in the District of Columbia said many of the changes the National Park Service is considering would be unconstitutional if adopted. Arthur Spitzer, the group's legal co-director, said that if cost recovery requirements had been in effect in 1963, the historic march featuring the Rev. Martin Luther King's \\\"I have a dream\\\" speech probably couldn't have happened.\\n\\n\\\"The National Park Service cannot seek to balance its budget on the backs of people seeking to exercise their constitutional rights,\\\" Spitzer said.\\n\\nSpitzer said the ACLU's Washington chapter supports some of the changes the administration is considering, such as adding to the list of areas where large numbers of people can demonstrate in the nation's capital without permits. It says these venues are often more convenient for demonstrators and have plenty of room to accommodate hundreds of people without disruption.\\n\\nSpitzer said a proposal to shrink pedestrian access in front of the White House along Pennsylvania Avenue would violate a court order. He said it's also inconsistent with the Secret Service's plans to install a taller, stronger fence with special anti-climbing features. The new fence is designed to allow the public access to the historic site while also meeting modern-day security standards. Under the proposed rule, about 80 percent of the White House sidewalk would be closed off, leaving a five-foot portion for \\\"pedestrian access.\\\"\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the National Park Service said the proposed change to the sidewalk came at the request of the Secret Service.\\n\\n--------\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:26:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"47.50012"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-120.50147"},"__v":0}

Though his humorous personality is ripe for connecting with sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders, Lane said it took time to adapt to a different style of policing.\\n\\nOn the night shift for his whole career, Lane now is up early greeting students as they get off the bus at 7:15 a.m.\\n\\nUsed to arresting people and handing them over to the courts, Lane now has to figure out how to maintain a good relationship with a student who gets in trouble but will come back to school.\\n\\nOnce answering only to police supervisors, Lane now consults with administrators, teachers and counselors before determining how to move forward.\\n\\nAnd the job tests his memory, too.\\n\\nLane said he knows lot of parents and students because of his own children -- Emerson, 11, and Brooks, 9 -- and their involvement in sports. But since coming to Clark Lane, he has struggled to learn the names of all 600 students there -- and he has unique handshakes with eight students and counting.\\n\\n\\\"The biggest problem is trying to remember\\\" the handshakes, Lane said, laughing. \\\"I say, 'Listen, here's the rule: there can only be four or five moves. You start getting fancy on me and throw in some dance moves or something like that, forget about it.'\\\"\\n\\n'It's fun for me'\\n\\nOn a recent Thursday, countless students said hello, offered high-fives and played the circle game with Lane -- a game one wins by forming the \\\"OK\\\" symbol with one hand and tricking another person into looking at it.\\n\\nLane had lost the game earlier in the day, when a student said he had a steak sandwich for lunch. The student threw a circle down when Lane, skeptical, checked his lunch bag.\\n\\n\\\"It's fun for me, it really is,\\\" Lane said. \\\"You have fun with the job, but hopefully also form that connection where, if a student is going through a rough patch -- or a good patch -- you can talk to them. That's what they need.\\\"\\n\\nOne of the more common functions Lane performs is meeting with students who've acted up in class. In other schools, such students may be marched straight to the office. But Lane likes to take each one on a walk to figure out what went wrong and what can be done to fix it.\\n\\nSuch a call came up Thursday, when a student pulled out a cellphone and defied his teacher's orders to put it away. At first unwilling to admit what he had done was wrong, the student, with Lane's direction, eventually agreed to meet back up with Lane after lunch and apologize to the teacher.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of times, because we're able to interact in a positive way, we prevent a lot of stuff -- we don't let it get to that point,\\\" said Lane, who spent his final two years of high school in Waterford and has been here since. \\\"This is me taking a greater interest ... so hopefully I can influence the kids when they get older to make the right decision.\\\"\\n\\nLane also is involved in after-school projects, whether dropping by a program that pairs student volunteers with special-needs students, visiting colleagues volunteering their time to mentor students or watching sports matches.\\n\\n\\\"It's important for kids growing up to have relationships with us,\\\" Lane said. \\\"I have seven years left, but the officers coming up are mostly younger. (The students) are going to grow up with these officers, so that connection's huge.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Lane visits the town's three elementary schools whenever an issue arises, at least one patrol officer also drops in each day as part of the International Association of Chiefs of Police's \\\"Every School, Every Day\\\" initiative, which launched after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\\n\\nLane also is involved in an ongoing effort to provide key cards, labeled maps and school tours to patrol officers so they'll know where to go and have easier access if an emergency situation were to arise.\\n\\n\\\"It benefits me to make sure everybody knows what's going on,\\\" said Lane, who has a three-year term and said he will stay as long as his department thinks it makes sense.\\n\\nIn Waterford, where at least one officer has been stationed in the schools since 1988, Lane said his biggest takeaway is clear.\\n\\n\\\"You appreciate what teachers do, and administrators,\\\" Lane said. \\\"But to see what they do every day, to see them have such a great attitude and personality and to be so motivated every day, even when their kids are having a bad day ... that's the most impressive thing for me.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:26:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Waterford\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"52.25833"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-7.11194"},"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc282ed54bb9c37288d3e8d"},"title":"\"Red Sox have little choice but to believe David Price is due\"","body":"\"BOSTON -- When David Price walked off the mound last week amid his latest playoff defeat, the stands at Fenway Park were packed with frustrated Red Sox fans who could have unleashed a venomous onslaught on the bewildered left-hander.\\n\\nMany of them did boo, of course. But the overall reaction was unmistakably restrained. As much as the Boston fans, who have had a contentious relationship with Price during his time with the Red Sox, may have wanted to unload on him, they also knew a deeper truth: They need him.\\n\\nSo does manager Alex Cora, who believes that if the Red Sox are going to win the American League Championship Series and then capture a World Series title, they must give the ball to Price, who may be the most overdue pitcher in the history of postseason baseball.\\n\\nAn elite starter in the regular season, Price has repeatedly gone astray in October, and his four teams have lost all 10 of his postseason starts. Price has two playoff wins in relief, but his record in postseason starts is 0-9 with a 6.18 ERA, and he has surrendered 13 home runs in those 10 games.\\n\\nIt is an unambiguous pattern, but Cora said he trusted Price to finally change his fate Sunday, in Game 2 of the AL Championship Series against the Houston Astros. If Price cannot break the pattern, Cora's choice could mean doom for the Red Sox, especially if they already lost Game 1.\\n\\n\\\"I do feel that there's a few things that got away from him the last few starts,\\\" Cora said. \\\"And we do feel that in Game 2 he'll get back to attack the hitters in a certain way. That's the beauty of David.\\\"\\n\\nNow more is at stake than Price's postseason reputation. If he fails again and the Red Sox do not advance to the World Series, the decision could haunt Cora and the Boston front office for years.\\n\\n\\\"We do feel that he will get back to that guy that pitched from the All-Star break all the way until mid-September,\\\" Cora said.\\n\\nCora could have opted to put Price in the bullpen, where he has largely been effective in the payoffs, and start Nathan Eovaldi or Rick Porcello in Game 2. But that could leave the Red Sox scrambling for a Game 4 starter or opting for the risky bullpen strategy -- employing many relievers including Price, their most expensive pitcher. But relegating him to the bullpen for a second straight year could affect Price's self-confidence and jeopardize the Red Sox' long-term investment in him.\\n\\nPrice came to Boston in 2016 after signing a seven-year, $217 million contract, and the past three years have not gone smoothly. The low point came a year ago when he verbally accosted Dennis Eckersley -- a former Red Sox pitcher who is now one of their broadcasters, as well as a fan favorite -- on the team plane over comments Eckersley had made about the Sox. Compounding the issue, Price did not pitch well that year, and he was relegated to the bullpen.\\n\\nThis year, he had problems with nerves in his pitching hand, which prompted speculation about the effects of Price's video-game habits and about his reaction to cold weather. But Price pitched well this season: He compiled a 16-7 record with a 3.58 ERA, and in the second half of the season went 6-1 with a 2.25 ERA. His one loss in that period came at Yankee Stadium in September, where a few fans of the home team taunted him with chants of \\\"Who's your daddy?\\\"\\n\\nBut his overall success in the regular season will mean little Sunday if he performs the way he did in Game 2 of the division series against the Yankees at Fenway Park. Price recorded only five outs, surrendering two home runs and three runs overall.\\n\\nBut Cora noted that Price has pitched much better against the Astros and might have been Boston's best option out of the bullpen in last year's playoffs against Houston, which eliminated the Red Sox in a division series. Price relieved in two games, pitching 6 2/3 innings overall without allowing a run. Over his career, Price is 6-2 with a 2.94 ERA against Houston.\\n\\n\\\"I like his matchup against the Astros, obviously,\\\" said Chris Sale, Boston's Game 1 starter. \\\"He's pitched well against them the last couple of years. And he was the only reason we had a chance last year in the playoffs against Houston. So I like where we're at.\\\"\\n\\nPrice has other supporters besides Sale, Cora and the Red Sox front office that invested so heavily in him. Justin Verlander, the Astros ace, pitched alongside Price for the Detroit Tigers in 2014 and 2015, and the two remain good friends. Verlander attributed Price's postseason numbers to something like an extended fluke.\\n\\n\\\"I do find that odd,\\\" he said. \\\"Honestly, I hope the trend continues for the short term.\\\"\\n\\nOn July 30, 2015, Price was traded by the Tigers to the Toronto Blue Jays, where another manager showed faith in him. John Gibbons, who recently stepped down as Toronto's manager, said that Price was a totally selfless player when they were together. He said Price volunteered, unsolicited, to pitch out of the bullpen when the Blue Jays lost their only left-handed reliever, Brett Cecil, to injury in a division series against the Texas Rangers.\\n\\n\\\"He came to me and said, 'Skip, I can do whatever you need, just let me know,'\\\" Gibbons said. \\\"I'll never forget that. A lot of guys wouldn't make that offer, but he did. I love the guy.\\\"\\n\\nGibbons used Price in relief of R.A. Dickey in Game 4 and recorded the win. But some wondered whether Gibbons turned to Price in Game 4 so he would not be available to start Game 5. Gibbons called that theory nonsense.\\n\\n\\\"Not true at all,\\\" Gibbons said. \\\"We just needed him in the pen.\\\"\\n\\nAfter Toronto won that series, it moved on to the ALCS, against the Kansas City Royals, and like Cora, Gibbons showed his faith and returned Price to the rotation. Price started Games 2 and 6 and gave up eight earned runs in 13 1/3 innings, and Kansas City won both games and the series.\\n\\nGibbons acknowledged that the postseason losing trend must affect Price, at least mentally.\\n\\n\\\"He can't get away from it,\\\" Gibbons said. \\\"Everyone reminds him of it, and he knows the situation. But he's still one of their big dogs, and he does well against Houston. If they are going to win it, they need Dave.\\\"\\n\\nPrice has one more thing going for him against Houston. He has a French bulldog named Astro. According to the Baseball Reference website, Price's nickname is Astro's Dad. Cora and the Red Sox are gambling that Price makes that even more true in Game 2.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:26:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Boston\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"42.35843"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-71.05977"},"__v":0}

First-year Cardinals coach Steve Wilks was impressed immediately with Fitzgerald's leadership abilities.\\n\\n\\\"Everything you see that's advertised is totally true,\\\" Wilks said. \\\"Just a real pro, a guy that comes to work each and every day. Phenomenal. Even 15 years in, what he practices is unbelievable. And a great role model for the young guys.\\\"\\n\\nHe is a role model for players beyond the Cardinals, as well. During the offseason, when Fitzgerald returns to the Twin Cities, he often works out with Vikings receiver Adam Thielen, a fellow Minnesota native.\\n\\nFitzgerald has twice led the NFL in receptions. Entering Sunday's game, Thielen is the league leader with 47 catches for 589 yards.\\n\\n\\\"I've learned a lot from Larry,\\\" said Thielen, a five-year veteran who made the Pro Bowl for the first time last season. \\\"Not just being personal with him, but watching him for a long time before I was even in the NFL. ...

It's cool when guys that are at his status and have had success like he has still care about others and reach out to others.\\\"\\n\\nIt's not just his work on the field that has gained Fitzgerald respect. He has become a pillar in the Phoenix area for his work in the community. After the 2016 season, he shared the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award with New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\\n\\nHe established the Larry Fitzgerald First Down Fund, a charity that helps support Arizona youth. In Minnesota, he works with his father, Larry Fitzgerald Sr., a sports writer and broadcaster, on the Carol Fitzgerald Memorial Fund. The fund was established by his father after Fitzgerald's mother died of a brain hemorrhage in 2003 while being treated for breast cancer.\\n\\n\\\"I'm hoping that is still to come,\\\" Fitzgerald said when asked about his greatest achievement off the field. \\\"I like to believe the Lord put me on the earth for something much more important than catching a pigskin ball. The game has given me a wonderful platform, and it's helped me do some things I'm really proud of, some of the things that my parents taught me and showed me as a child, how important it is to serve others. And I'm hoping post-career I'm able to do that on a larger scale.\\\"\\n\\nMcCain a mentor, friend\\n\\nFitzgerald's most visible moment this year came outside of football. In August, he was chosen to deliver a eulogy at the funeral of Arizona Sen. John McCain.\\n\\nDespite a 47-year difference in their ages, Fitzgerald and McCain developed a close friendship.\\n\\n\\\"I'm very proud and appreciative of the relationship I had with him,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There were so many wonderful conversations and moments that I shared with him over the last years that I had known him. ... There are many differences between the two of us, from age, I played sports and he's a politician. There's no similarities there, but he took a liking to me, and I learned so much from him.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's interest away from sports has led him to become a world traveler. He has been to 100 countries, reaching that milestone with visits this year to Iceland and Sweden.\\n\\n\\\"I've always been proud of Larry the way he carries himself, the way he lights up a room,\\\" his father said. \\\"People gravitate to him. He's helped so many people through his foundation, my foundation. It's always been gratifying as a parent to be told by people who don't know your son that they are so proud of the way he carries himself.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald Sr., 61, was an offensive tackle at Indiana State from 1975-77, and says with pride that his son got much of his athleticism from him. Fitzgerald Sr., though, didn't realize how good his son was at football until he first began to play in 1993.\\n\\n\\\"When he was 10, my wife signed him up for a pee-wee football team at Dr. Martin Luther King Park in South Minneapolis,\\\" he father remembered. \\\"I started watching him and saw him make all these moves and stuff, and I'm saying, 'Man, he really can play.' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's abilities eventually took him to Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he was a two-time All-American, and to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was an All-American and Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2003. Fitzgerald was so good in high school that a number of Vikings players regularly attended his games.\\n\\nHe's a Vikings fan\\n\\nFitzgerald developed a relationship with Vikings players while serving as one of the team's ball boys from 1999-2001, his sophomore through senior seasons in high school. Fitzgerald got the job thanks to his father having started a radio show with Green in 1994, the third of his 10 years as coach.\\n\\n\\\"Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter, Randy Moss, Korey Stringer, they were all at (Fitzgerald's Holy Angels games),\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There would be 2,000 or 3,000 fans at the game and they would see the Vikings players and all be running up in the stands to get autographs.\\\"\\n\\nVikings players also provided valuable advice to Fitzgerald. He said their influence has played a role in his ability to have such a long career.\\n\\n\\\"I was able to see every day, I see Robert Smith, I see Cris Carter and I see Chris Walsh, Jake Reed, guys getting into the cold tub and working out and doing everything and getting massages and eating right and acupuncture and things like that that I've implemented in my career,\\\" Fitzgerald said.\\n\\nFitzgerald also became an avid Vikings fan, something that has continued ... most of the time.\\n\\n\\\"I pull for those guys every week except when I'm playing against them,\\\" he said. \\\"I still got a little purple running through my veins.\\\"\\n\\nIt hasn't gone well for the Cardinals in Fitzgerald's trips home. They are 0-5 in Minneapolis. Fitzgerald has had some big games in defeat, making 11 catches for 172 yards in 2006 and seven grabs for 107 yards in 2010.\\n\\nFitzgerald, though, has moved beyond his numbers. He said the reason he has continued to play is to get that elusive Super Bowl ring.\\n\\nIn Super Bowl XLIII, he came close. Fitzgerald scored on a 64-yard pass from Warner to give the Cardinals a 23-20 lead with 2:37 left in the game. But the Steelers won 27-23 when Ben Roethlisberger threw a 6-yard TD pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds remaining.\\n\\n\\\"I don't need any more catches or yards or touchdowns,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"I don't think any of that is going to change my place in history, but you know on a personal (level), you always want to win a championship. That's the only reason you play. ... You want to be a part of something special like winning a championship, and that's the reason I come back.\\\"\\n\\n'Favorite son'\\n\\nThe Cardinals, though, aren't looking like a contender this season. They are 1-4 and ranked last in the NFL in total offense.\\n\\nSam Bradford, who played the past two seasons for Minnesota, was the starting quarterback for the first three games before being replaced by rookie Josh Rosen. Both have struggled, and Fitzgerald has just 17 receptions for 176 yards coming off three straight 100-catch seasons.\\n\\n\\\"I think this is his last year in football,\\\" said Joe Theismann, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and NFL analyst. \\\"I think he'll move on to the next phase of his life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Theismann doesn't profess to have inside knowledge of Fitzgerald's plans, he is friendly with the wide receiver and has has played golf with him. Theismann was named NFL Man of the Year in 1982 with the Redskins, and said he has a book coming out that will include a reference to Fitzgerald's work ethic.\\n\\n\\\"When I was a broadcaster (for ESPN games during Fitzgerald's first three seasons), I wanted to interview him and I would stay and watch him after practice catching 50 or more balls,\\\" Thiesmann said. \\\"Larry Fitzgerald, to me, is the epitome of greatness on and off the field. I would call him the favorite son of the Minneapolis area.\\\"\\n\\nVikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who has gotten to know Fitzgerald, calls him the \\\"mayor of Phoenix.\\\"\\n\\nWhatever the title, Warner is proud of what Fitzgerald has accomplished and flattered that any advice he once provided helped.\\n\\n\\\"There are very few guys that have had the kind of legacy that Larry has had, being seen as an unbelievable person and an unbelievable player,\\\" Warner said. \\\"It's been an honor to become good friends with him and seeing the legacy he's going to leave.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:26:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Minneapolis\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"44.97997"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-93.26384"},"__v":0}

He has been to 100 countries, reaching that milestone with visits this year to Iceland and Sweden.\\n\\n\\\"I've always been proud of Larry the way he carries himself, the way he lights up a room,\\\" his father said. \\\"People gravitate to him. He's helped so many people through his foundation, my foundation. It's always been gratifying as a parent to be told by people who don't know your son that they are so proud of the way he carries himself.\\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald Sr., 61, was an offensive tackle at Indiana State from 1975-77, and says with pride that his son got much of his athleticism from him. Fitzgerald Sr., though, didn't realize how good his son was at football until he first began to play in 1993.\\n\\n\\\"When he was 10, my wife signed him up for a pee-wee football team at Dr. Martin Luther King Park in South Minneapolis,\\\" he father remembered. \\\"I started watching him and saw him make all these moves and stuff, and I'm saying, 'Man, he really can play.' \\\"\\n\\nFitzgerald's abilities eventually took him to Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he was a two-time All-American, and to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was an All-American and Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2003. Fitzgerald was so good in high school that a number of Vikings players regularly attended his games.\\n\\nHe's a Vikings fan\\n\\nFitzgerald developed a relationship with Vikings players while serving as one of the team's ball boys from 1999-2001, his sophomore through senior seasons in high school. Fitzgerald got the job thanks to his father having started a radio show with Green in 1994, the third of his 10 years as coach.\\n\\n\\\"Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter, Randy Moss, Korey Stringer, they were all at (Fitzgerald's Holy Angels games),\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"There would be 2,000 or 3,000 fans at the game and they would see the Vikings players and all be running up in the stands to get autographs.\\\"\\n\\nVikings players also provided valuable advice to Fitzgerald. He said their influence has played a role in his ability to have such a long career.\\n\\n\\\"I was able to see every day, I see Robert Smith, I see Cris Carter and I see Chris Walsh, Jake Reed, guys getting into the cold tub and working out and doing everything and getting massages and eating right and acupuncture and things like that that I've implemented in my career,\\\" Fitzgerald said.\\n\\nFitzgerald also became an avid Vikings fan, something that has continued ... most of the time.\\n\\n\\\"I pull for those guys every week except when I'm playing against them,\\\" he said. \\\"I still got a little purple running through my veins.\\\"\\n\\nIt hasn't gone well for the Cardinals in Fitzgerald's trips home. They are 0-5 in Minneapolis. Fitzgerald has had some big games in defeat, making 11 catches for 172 yards in 2006 and seven grabs for 107 yards in 2010.\\n\\nFitzgerald, though, has moved beyond his numbers. He said the reason he has continued to play is to get that elusive Super Bowl ring.\\n\\nIn Super Bowl XLIII, he came close. Fitzgerald scored on a 64-yard pass from Warner to give the Cardinals a 23-20 lead with 2:37 left in the game. But the Steelers won 27-23 when Ben Roethlisberger threw a 6-yard TD pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds remaining.\\n\\n\\\"I don't need any more catches or yards or touchdowns,\\\" Fitzgerald said. \\\"I don't think any of that is going to change my place in history, but you know on a personal (level), you always want to win a championship. That's the only reason you play. ... You want to be a part of something special like winning a championship, and that's the reason I come back.\\\"\\n\\n'Favorite son'\\n\\nThe Cardinals, though, aren't looking like a contender this season. They are 1-4 and ranked last in the NFL in total offense.\\n\\nSam Bradford, who played the past two seasons for Minnesota, was the starting quarterback for the first three games before being replaced by rookie Josh Rosen. Both have struggled, and Fitzgerald has just 17 receptions for 176 yards coming off three straight 100-catch seasons.\\n\\n\\\"I think this is his last year in football,\\\" said Joe Theismann, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and NFL analyst. \\\"I think he'll move on to the next phase of his life.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Theismann doesn't profess to have inside knowledge of Fitzgerald's plans, he is friendly with the wide receiver and has has played golf with him. Theismann was named NFL Man of the Year in 1982 with the Redskins, and said he has a book coming out that will include a reference to Fitzgerald's work ethic.\\n\\n\\\"When I was a broadcaster (for ESPN games during Fitzgerald's first three seasons), I wanted to interview him and I would stay and watch him after practice catching 50 or more balls,\\\" Thiesmann said. \\\"Larry Fitzgerald, to me, is the epitome of greatness on and off the field. I would call him the favorite son of the Minneapolis area.\\\"\\n\\nVikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who has gotten to know Fitzgerald, calls him the \\\"mayor of Phoenix.\\\"\\n\\nWhatever the title, Warner is proud of what Fitzgerald has accomplished and flattered that any advice he once provided helped.\\n\\n\\\"There are very few guys that have had the kind of legacy that Larry has had, being seen as an unbelievable person and an unbelievable player,\\\" Warner said. \\\"It's been an honor to become good friends with him and seeing the legacy he's going to leave.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:25:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Minneapolis\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"44.97997"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-93.26384"},"__v":0}

If you wondered after that tumultuous offseason, if you weren't sure during that surprising run through the first half of the season, if you worried after that loss last week at Florida - well, here's a data point that will send shock waves through college football. In easily the most significant win of Ed Orgeron's tenure, the Tigers set up the opportunity for even bigger victories.\\n\\nHere are three takeaways from No. 12 LSU's 36-16 defeat of No. 2 Georgia:\\n\\n- This was easily the most impressive performance in a seven-game run that remains astounding, considering the expectations. Heck, it was the Tigers' most impressive victory since 2011, that 9-6 slugfest against No. 2 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. But that LSU team was ranked No. 1. This one? No one was really sure what to make of it after the loss in Gainesville. But the defense stymied Georgia. And although the Tigers had to settle for field goals instead of touchdowns, allowing it to remain a game into the fourth quarter, they put it away with a drive that was keyed by Joe Burrow's pretty pass down the seam to Justin Jefferson. Two plays later, Burrow scored on a sneak. And when LSU recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, the party in the Bayou had begun.\\n\\nMELTDOWN: Nebraska extends program-worst start to 0-6 after Northwestern loss\\n\\nHEATED EXCHANGE: Florida, Vanderbilt coaches have words after targeting call\\n\\nHIGHLIGHT REEL: Ohio State WR K.J. Hill makes wild one-handed touchdown grab\\n\\n- Everything remains in play for Georgia, though the margin for error is almost certainly gone. Georgia's path to the College Football Playoff now likely means winning out (or perhaps losing only once more) and definitely includes winning the SEC championship.\\n\\nBut far more important was the revelation: This Georgia team is not that Georgia team.\\n\\nIts No. 2 ranking was built on 2017's production, which is why the issue going forward isn't so much the potential path to the playoff as the Bulldogs' production. Their defensive front seven only faintly resembles the sometimes dominant unit of last year. Jake Fromm hasn't been as good as he was late last season (in the first half Saturday, he completed only 5 of 16 passes for 47 yards).\\n\\nIt's only one loss. But it might have exposed some significant flaws. And though Georgia could roll from here, there's no certainty the Bulldogs will even win the SEC East.\\n\\n- Coach 'O' was ready to go ... for it. Three times during the first half - and then again in the third quarter - LSU went for it on fourth-and-short. The Tigers converted all four times. And although the conversions were significant in producing a 16-0 halftime lead, they also served to make a collective statement: LSU wasn't going to get pushed around; the Tigers would do the pushing. Contrast that with Kirby Smart's very Les Miles-like decision - right down to the actual play call - to try a fake field goal that required kicker Rodrigo Blankenship to run at least 20 yards to get 9 and a first down. It failed. And with Georgia trailing only 3-0 at the time, it was an odd decision.

All the receivers help bring me along on a daily basis, the coaches, just giving me all these resources I need and me taking advantage of it, going home and studying daily. I think ... having a certain amount of experience in the league already and seeing so many different offenses and stuff, I think the language of it is somewhat familiar. It hasn't been too tough.\\\"\\n\\nGordon missed two seasons because of substance-abuse suspensions, but when available he played under four head different coaches and five offensive coordinators in Cleveland, so the experience of learning new systems has helped.\\n\\nIn two games since being traded to the Patriots three weeks ago, Gordon has four catches for 82 yards and a touchdown. He's had solid production for someone who's played 34 total offensive snaps. But familiarity has also been fostered with Gordon's locker right next to Brady.\\n\\n\\\"Most of the day we end up talking football, whether it be in the locker room here, briefly, or most of the meeting rooms or time after practice,\\\" Gordon said. \\\"We carve our times and make it happen. We make sure if there's something that might be a concern for him or me or he wants to know how I like to do something or I want to know how he wants to do something, I just ask and he's open about it. He makes it easy for me to communicate with him. It makes it a real natural type of relationship.\\\"\\n\\nAs he spoke with reporters for the first time before a Patriots game, Gordon also detailed the assistance he's received from New England character coach Jack Easterby. Hired in 2013 in the aftermath of former tight end Aaron Hernandez's murder charge, Easterby is the only character coach on an NFL staff. His aid has come mostly away from the field.\\n\\n\\\"Jack's been huge with helping me move and get acclimated to the city, to the environment. He's been hands-on. Very hands-on,\\\" Gordon said. \\\"Kinda just made this whole process that much easier for me, so really appreciative of him.\\\"\\n\\nGordon says he's moved his family to the area. He and his girlfriend are actively working to make a new home.\\n\\n\\\"I consider the people in this community and around it family. They treat us nice everywhere we go,\\\" Gordon said. \\\"It's been a great experience.\\\"\\n\\nCHRIS HOGAN was a new addition to the team's injury report Wednesday with a thigh injury, and he was a non-participant Thursday.\\n\\nBut not to worry. According to reports, the Patriots receiver should be cleared to play against the Chiefs.\\n\\nHogan has 11 receptions on 19 targets for 143 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Hogan's played at least 86 percent of the team's offensive snaps in every game to date.

LSU converted all four times it ran an offensive play on fourth down, sustaining three drives that produced a total of 13 points.\\n\\nIn another instance, Orgeron called timeout and elected to punt on fourth-and-2 after the offense initially remained on the field. That decision pinned Georgia at its 4, and Kristian Fulton's interception of Jake Fromm's pass shortly afterward set up another of Cole Tracy's five field goals.\\n\\nClyde Edwards-Helaire rushed for 133 yards for LSU (6-1, 3-1 Southeastern Conference), and Justin Jefferson caught six passes for 108 yards, including a 41-yard snag of a pass rifled over the middle and between converging defenders.

Butler by all accounts had commandeered practice on Wednesday, arriving late, exiting early, punking teammates and cursing his bosses in between. On Thursday, he did (or maybe didn't, depending on which Twitter account you believed) convene a players-only meeting after Thibodeau canceled a scheduled workout.\\n\\nWhat is increasingly clear is that Butler's antics and posturing initially intended solely to serve and impact him was having some unpleasant ripple effects on a team that's about as poorly prepared as any in the league for the start of the regular season next week. The longer it drags on, the more this is certain: No one is going to get out of this untouched. When you're sitting near a food fight, you're inevitably going to get splattered.\\n\\nHere, in no particular order, are people and things that have taken hits thanks to Butler's craving for attention, his bizarro approach to leadership and his ill-advised way of fulfilling a contract:\\n\\nKarl-Anthony Towns. Towns has been Butler's heavy bag before and during this regrettable episode, in the past with criticism of his defense and most recently in remarks by Butler about the big fellow's work habits and candor. The 22-year-old - who may just be targeted by Butler out of jealousy over the five-year, $190 million contract extension Towns signed last month - has tried to stay out of the fray, only to be yanked in by Butler's comments to ESPN on Wednesday. Normally an affable, enthusiastic interviewee, Towns went Stepford guy at Friday's shootaround, repeating a couple of answers regardless of the questions.\\n\\nNBA Getty Images\\n\\nFinally, asked if he was tired of the same Butler-driven topics, a glum, dead-eyed Towns said, \\\"Are you tired of hearing me say 'We're playing basketball today here in Milwaukee?'\\\" He didn't smile.\\n\\nTom Thibodeau. Thibodeau isn't blameless in this, but there's been a piling-on from Minnesota and national media that simply isn't fair. He did not invite or anticipate Butler's unprofessional reaction to the Wolves' grown-up business decision not to dismantle their roster to pay him bigger, sooner, rather than later. Thibodeau arrived with a mandate to end a 13-year playoff drought and did just that after properly identifying Butler as a star through determination and sweat, a veteran who could help the Wolves at both ends of the court and in their locker room.\\n\\nThibodeau vouched for Butler to his team owner, Glen Taylor, and to the other players when he acquired the 6-foot-8 swingman from Chicago. He rightfully didn't throw other helpful players overboard to tear up Butler's contract this summer, instead offering \\\"only\\\" a four-year, $110 million extension available without shedding some of his teammates.\\n\\nWe all should have the opportunity to go haywire over such an offer.\\n\\nNow Thibodeau's great sin is staying loyal both to Butler (given their history with the Bulls) and to the plan that brought the coach to Minnesota. It might wind up costing him his coaching job, his role as Wolves' chief basketball officer or both.\\n\\nTaj Gibson, Jeff Teague and Anthony Tolliver. And any other Wolves player who bought into or signed onto the idea that this was a team on the rise, with key pieces in place for a sustained run of high-seed playoff appearances.\\n\\nTimberwolves fans. These folks, who either show up diligently at Target Center or keep their powder dry for when they can buy tickets to see a real contender, can't seem to catch a break. It's been one bout of dysfunction after another, their team and, by association, themselves cast as laughingstocks in flyover NBA land.\\n\\nTruth. For a guy who talks a lot about being honest and valuing that in others, Butler sure has been mendacious. He says he wants to win, then designates mediocre or worse franchises as preferred trade destinations. He claims to be a leader, yet can't cope with Towns or Wiggins and their allegedly oh-so-frustrating natures. Oh, and ESPN just happened to be in the hinterlands - lights, camera, action! - the day Butler hijacks practice.\\n\\nRight. These theatrics are about money and attention. And maybe a little spite.\\n\\nSpine. If Thibodeau and Taylor are serious about doing what's right for their team - rather than what pleases Miami's Pat Riley, no matter how profane he allegedly gets - they should be looking seriously at the options they have for enforcing their deal with Butler. A fine, a suspension and maybe even a breach-of-contract showdown should be on the table, given his conduct already detrimental to the team. But there is no sense the Wolves are ready to play hardball, or even contemplating it.\\n\\nIt's disquieting, too, that none of Butler's teammates has called him on his selfishness. When Kevin Garnett dominated Wolves practices with his game and his mouth, it was fuel and energy for the future Hall of Famer and his teammates. When Butler did that this week, it was all about Jimmy.\\n\\nAndrew Wiggins. Wait, scratch that. Wiggins can't be collateral damage. He's Teflon, or rather, Kevlar, as far as anything touching or rattling him from his eerily unmoved, unmotivated, unaffected centeredness. He wasn't in Milwaukee Friday either, keeping vigil for the birth of his first child. With that, his dog, his video-game console and his five-year, $147 million contract, life is good with or without Butler.\\n\\nThe views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA or its clubs.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:19:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Milwaukee\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"43.0389"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-87.90647"},"__v":0}

The stretch limo barreled down a hill past a stop sign into another vehicle in the parking lot. All 17 passengers and the driver were killed, as well as two pedestrians standing in the parking lot.\\n\\n\\\"The question that is in the hearts of so many is: Why?\\\" The Rev. O. Robert DeMaritnis told hundreds of mourners. \\\"Why did these 20 individuals have to be taken from us so quickly and so unexpectedly?\\\"\\n\\nDeMaritnis spoke on an altar flanked by pictures of Allison King, sister Abigail Jackson and her husband Adam Jackson, sister Mary Dyson and her husband Robert Dyson, sister Amy Steenburg and her husband Axel Steenburg and his older brother, Richard Steenburg.\\n\\nUrns containing their remains were placed beneath the pictures, with each of the three married couples sharing urns. Five teddy bears lay by the urns, one for each young child who lost a parent.\\n\\nA week ago, the group -- most of them in their 30s -- was headed to a birthday party for Amy Steenburg at a local brewery in Cooperstown. DeMaritnis said he believes Amy and her friends were able to celebrate Amy's 30th birthday, but in their afterlife. He told mourners to take solace in their eternal life.\\n\\nDeMaritnis married Amy and Axel Steenburg in June. He recalled them as a laughter-loving couple who made a sign asking wedding guests not to take pictures, because \\\"we suggest that you live in the moment.\\\"\\n\\nHe had wondered why they never picked up the sign. Now, he said, he knew.\\n\\n\\\"That's what they're asking me to ask you to do today,\\\" DeMaritnis said, holding the sign aloft.\\n\\nThe sisters grew up in Amsterdam, a small upstate New York city, and many of the victims have deep ties to the area. The city has been stricken with grief amid a series of funerals.\\n\\nMeanwhile, authorities continue to investigate the cause of the crash while prosecutors have charged the operator of the limo company, Nauman Hussain, with criminally negligent homicide, saying he allowed an improperly licensed driver to operate an \\\"unserviceable\\\" vehicle.

His fumble set up a second-quarter Vandy score that put Florida in the kind of hole that looks just this side of hopeless, down 21-3.\\n\\n\\\"That was terrible,\\\" Dan Mullen said of the fumble. \\\"After the one turnover he got moody and (quarterback coach) Brian (Johnson) screamed at him. And that was about it, you know. And then he, he'll tell you, he was moody. And then he just stopped.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then he started.\\n\\n\\\"I was pissed off because I fumbled,\\\" Franks said. \\\"I just wanted to get the ball back. I wanted to make up for it.\\\"\\n\\nHe did, leading Florida to an unforgettable comeback Saturday.\\n\\nIt started with the drive after a fumble when he went 4-for-5 for 52 yards and overcame a bad sack to lead the Gators into the end zone. The swing pass to Lamical Perine that went for 63 yards just before the half helped pulled the Gators within a score.\\n\\nBut when the second half started with more of the same problems of the first half -- nine plays in two possessions and one first down -- Mullen went to his bag of tricks to stop the oil from leaking.\\n\\nTommy Townsend's 18-yard run on a fake punt might have been the biggest play in a game full of them.\\n\\nIt was a play Florida practiced all week and Mullen called at the perfect time. Again.\\n\\n\\\"We needed some momentum, and it seemed like a good time to call it,\\\" Mullen said with a shrug.\\n\\nIronically, Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said later his gut told him to try to block the kick. Instead, Townsend had nothing but artificial turf in front of him for the first dozen yards.\\n\\n\\\"Run hard and don't go down easy,\\\" Townsend said. \\\"As soon as I gave (his blockers) the 'go' call, it opened up perfectly. It was amazing.\\n\\n\\\"I've been really excited for this play call all week. We had to have the right look and we had the right look. I was so juiced up I didn't really show it when I came to the sidelines (after the play), but in my head I was screaming.\\\"\\n\\nFrom that point on, it was a different game.\\n\\nFranks drove Florida for a touchdown hitting Van Jefferson for a 38-yard score. Then it was Jordan Scarlett ripping off a 48-yard run for a touchdown and later Freddie Swain going airborne for another score.\\n\\nEventually, after all of the emotion of a game that got chippy between the coaches and saw Florida lose two linebackers to disqualification on one play, the Gators were left to celebrate on another opposing field.\\n\\nThe rope got held again.\\n\\n\\\"We just did what we had to do,\\\" said linebacker David Reese. \\\"The rope was slipping. We just had to dig our feet in the ground and know who we are.\\n\\n\\\"As long as we execute, we win the game.\\\"\\n\\nSimple, right? That's one reason there weren't a lot of banging helmets or rah-rah speeches in the locker room at halftime.\\n\\nBecause Florida's deficit wasn't caused by a trap game or the chill in the air or the time of the game or the 50-50 split of 30,000 fans.\\n\\nIt was caused by Florida making mistakes.\\n\\nThe emotions of the coaches going at it and causing the players to consider mixing it up had to be quelled at halftime rather than be used as fuel.\\n\\n\\\"We didn't really stay with the plan to win as a team,\\\" Franks said. \\\"It just shows you the resilience. We just had to keep on working and go on to the next play.\\\"\\n\\nMullen said his team didn't have a great week of practice and we kind of saw that coming.

They had no answers for the Bombers (1-1, 4-2) on either side of the ball. Ithaca doubled Union in total offense 376-185, and forced four interceptions.\\n\\nNabi was questionable because of assorted injuries, but he looked quite healthy early and often for the Bombers, who scored on their first possession of the game. Nabi hooked up with his favorite target, Will Gladney, for a 29-yard TD pass to cap a seven-play, 74-yard drive. Ithaca never looked back.\\n\\nThe Bombers allowed Union only one red-zone attempt, and the Dutchmen came up empty following three incomplete passes from the Bombers' 10-yard line early in the final quarter.\\n\\n\\\"We put in a lot of work in practice this week,\\\" Nabi said. \\\"We treated this like a business trip, although for me, it was nice to be back home for a little while. My high school coach kept texting me all week, and my parents brought everyone who knew me to the game.\\\"\\n\\nNabi said he feels like a much better quarterback than he was a year ago.\\n\\n\\\"I'm more confident with my teammates,\\\" Nabi said. \\\"Union has a very aggressive defense, but we have some very talented players. I think I have some of the best receivers in the country. We made some big plays today.\\\"\\n\\nNabi also found Gladney for a 5-yard TD pass in the second quarter, and Isaiah D'Haiti added a 2-yard scoring run. Brian Fallon closed out the scoring with a 42-yard field goal midway through the final quarter, and he just missed a 50-yarder late in the game.\\n\\nUnion was frustrated all day. Sophomore quarterback Will Bellamy completed 19 of 33 passes for 143 yards. Besides his four interceptions, he was sacked three times.\\n\\nAndre Ross Jr., ranked among the nation's best receivers in yards gained, caught only four passes for 18 yards.\\n\\nUnion's rushing attack was also stifled, with Travis Demby and Ike Irabor combining or only 51 net yards on 20 carries.\\n\\n\\\"In the end, we didn't execute our offense,\\\" Union head coach Jeff Behrman said. \\\"After the game, I asked our players who they were going to be as men and as teammates. It's time to look in the mirror. We will regroup tomorrow.\\\"\\n\\nAs expected, the Dutchmen were shocked by their performance, especially considering they felt they had a legitimate shot at a postseason playoff berth after their terrific start.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to keep it in perspective,\\\" Behrman said. \\\"We lost a football game.

They were turning us up. They motivated us a little bit more.\\n\\n\\\"They were just saying, 'Hey, they want to disrespect you guys. Go out there and take it over now.' That's what we did.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the incident there was some salty language exchanged between UF defensive coordinator Todd Grantham and Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason and one of his assistants.\\n\\nUF coach Dan Mullen downplayed the potential fracas after UF's 37-27 win.\\n\\n\\\"We're not going to get into that publicly at all,\\\" he said. \\\"Derek's a great, really close friend of mine. And I think, our sideline, we've got to make sure we're cleaner in that situation and he probably thinks the same thing, but there's nothing carrying over from that and nothing to get into publicly.\\\"\\n\\nThe Gators lost two linebackers to ejection during the incident -- Joseph for a second unsportsmanlike penalty and Houston for targeting.\\n\\n\\\"We got in the locker room and I said, 'Hey, everybody's got an unsportsmanlike penalty, so get another and you're thrown out of the game,' \\\" Mullen said. \\\"That was about it. It was more about the football part of it all to me, let's be smart and play football.\\n\\n\\\"Because it's not like we were perfect between the whistles, from snap to whistle. It wasn't like we were like a juggernaut in the first half right there with how we were executing and playing. Let's put the focus back on that and get back to execution.\\\"\\n\\nTwo 100-yard guys\\n\\nSpeaking of execution, that's exactly what the Gators had in the running game Saturday. They had two running backs -- Jordan Scarlett and Lamical Perine -- rush for more than 100 yards.\\n\\nScarlett had 121 and a touchdown, while Scarlett rushed for 113 and a TD. Coming into Saturday's game, no UF back had rushed for 100 yards in a game this season.\\n\\n\\\"We were tired of hearing everybody say other schools have got great running backs,\\\" Scarlett said. \\\"We knew how good we were and what we could do. We just needed to get the ball in our hands and show the world what was going on. I'm glad that we got to showcase that today.\\\"\\n\\nSuccess on the ground led to success through the air, quarterback Feleipe Franks said.\\n\\n\\\"The running backs had a really good day,\\\" Franks said. \\\"I told them all throughout the game that they set up every opportunity for me to throw the ball, the way they run downhill and with power.\\n\\n\\\"Our running backs had a really good day and it helped me out a lot.\\\"\\n\\nToo many big plays\\n\\nFlorida's overall defensive performance was OK, but not up to recent standards. And the Gators continued to be vulnerable at times, giving up big plays.\\n\\nIn Saturday's game, the defense gave up a 75-yard screen pass for a touchdown, a 43-yard run and two pass plays of more than 20 yards.\\n\\n\\\"Some of them, I think we're going to see a lack of effort. I think some we're going to have an MA, a missed assignment,\\\" Mullen said. \\\"On some, I don't think we strained to the level that's expected to erase and eliminate a big play.\\n\\n\\\"Guys have got to understand, if one guy makes a big mistake for a big play, everybody else can't sit there and say, 'Hey, I did my job.' We need guys to erase it. Hey, they created a big play. Erase it. They got a 12-yard play, 13, 14-yard play, erase it and make sure that's the end of it and make sure it doesn't go any further.\\\"\\n\\nJefferson celebrates return\\n\\nIt was a happy homecoming for Jefferson, who played his high school ball at Ravenwood High School in Nashville. His 38-yard TD reception late in the third quarter was a pivotal play in UF's comeback.\\n\\n\\\"It was nice, especially here in Nashville,\\\" Jefferson said. \\\"I had a lot of family and high school teammates and friends here. It was pretty exciting.\\\"\\n\\nJefferson credits Franks with holding the team together Saturday when things were tough early, then making plays when he had to in the second half.\\n\\n\\\"Feleipe did a great job of keeping our offense ready,\\\" he said. \\\"It was really Feleipe who got the offense together. We made the adjustments at halftime and came out here and won.\\n\\n\\\"That's just Feleipe. He's hardworking and doesn't let anything faze him. He came out and did his thing today.

We were really disappointed that it didn't contribute to a win last week, but we still could feel the style, so that's important to us and we're going to try and make a big push here through the middle of the season, see if we can get going by the halfway point, and like you said, getting back to .500 is really important right now.\\\"\\n\\nThe schedule hardly gets easier - Seattle has had just two home games so far and has just one more until Nov. 15, following the bye with a trip to Detroit, then a home game against a Chargers team that has lost only to the Chiefs and Rams, then another trip to LA to play the Rams again.\\n\\nBut at 3-3, the Seahawks could truly say they are, well, beginning to Come Together.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc282ed54bb9c37288d3eca"},"title":"\"Special permit lets disabled vets shoot moose on Alaska missile defense base - Sat, 13 Oct 2018 PST\"","body":"\"FORT GREELY, Alaska - By design, this hunting opportunity for wounded veterans of the armed forces is supposed to give hunters as good a chance of shooting a moose as possible.\\n\\nSince it began in 2014, 18 hunters have participated in the hunt on and around the Fort Greely missile defense base. All 18 hunters have successfully bagged a moose.\\n\\nBut even by the standards of this hunting permit, one hunt earlier this month was particularly fast. A bull showed himself along a quiet installation road a mere 10 minutes into the first full day of hunting. It was the biggest bull seen on post this season, hunt organizer and Fort Greely environmental chief Rick Barth said.\\n\\nThe animal was 85 yards from the road and quartering away. A break in the burned trees and other vegetation gave a clear shot to its vital organs.\\n\\nBarth stopped his side-by-side and quickly got out his homemade bipod, a pair of sticks tied together with a vacuum cleaner belt. He motioned for the hunter to use the sticks to stabilize his shot.\\n\\nThe hunter last week was Jerimiah Galloway, a BP well integrity engineer who lives in Wasilla when not working on the North Slope. Galloway is a former artillery platoon commander from the Fort Wainwright-based 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, who was injured during that unit's 2008 deployment to Iraq.\\n\\nLike many veterans, he doesn't like to talk about what happened to him downrange that earned him his Purple Heart. Like all participants in this hunt, Galloway has a 100 percent disability rating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\nGalloway grew up in North Carolina where he hunted everything from squirrels to white-tailed deer. He got right into Alaska hunting his first year in Fairbanks, shooting a caribou off the Dalton Highway that's now mounted at his home. He'd also shot a small bull moose.\\n\\nOn this year's hunt, he hoped to find a large bull moose to mount across from his caribou. He was after a more unusual trophy, too. When the Army sent him to Alaska in 2008, Galloway said he joked to his brother that he was going to send him a moose scrotum to make into a coin purse.\\n\\nGalloway's friend, Lee Pentimone, also came along on the trip. The two had been hunting partners on unsuccessful moose hunts the last two years. Both Galloway and Pentimone carried rifles for their Fort Greely hunt, although under the rules of the hunt, the second hunter is there strictly for bear protection.\\n\\nGalloway and Pentimone got into Delta Junction on Sept. 6, in time for a few hours of hunting. Barth set the hunters up at a tree stand where they enjoyed watching a group of three young bulls fighting. Galloway was careful to watch with his binoculars but put down his rifle so he wouldn't be tempted to take one of the smaller moose. In this hunt, any bull or cow without calves is legal. But Galloway was holding out a bigger bull.\\n\\n\\\"He was like a kid in a candy store,\\\" Pentimone said.\\n\\nThe next morning, their first full day of hunting, Barth met his hunters at 6:15 at their base camp, a comfortable - if institutional - apartment on Fort Greely. Some of his out-of-state hunters are disappointed in these accommodations because they want a true Alaska roughing-it experience, Barth said.\\n\\n\\\"The Alaskans don't usually complain,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe temperature was in the 40s, and thick fog hung over the installation. Galloway and Pentimone said they were happy to have spent the night indoors. The party got into a pair of side-by-sides and started across the installation just as a recording of reveille played over the post's public address system.\\n\\nBarth led the group into a construction site where during the daytime heavy equipment pounds the earth to compact the site for a future missile field.\\n\\nBut at 6:30 a.m. the equipment was silent and at least one bull moose was active along the scar of an old forest fire off the side of the road.\\n\\nAfter getting set up on the bipod, Galloway spent about half a minute peering into the scope, making sure he was comfortable with the shot. When he pulled the trigger, the blast of his .338-caliber rifle was followed immediately by the thud of his projectile connecting with something.\\n\\nIn his 13 years of moose-hunting experience, Barth said he's always seen moose stand stunned after being shot. But Barth brightened as he reminded himself he'd clearly heard the bullet make contact.\\n\\n\\\"Well, you got him. He can't get very far. There are fences all around,\\\" he said.\\n\\nElecting not to send the wounded animal on a further adrenaline-fueled sprint, Barth advised they leave the animal to die. They would return after breakfast, in which time the sun might burn off more of the fog, making it easier to find the downed bull.\\n\\nThe moose of Fort Greely can be a nuisance, Barth saod, as the party walked to the mess hall for breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"I've seen windows with moose nose prints on them,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAs if on cue, Barth walked by a splatter of moose diarrhea in the middle of the sidewalk outside the dining facility.\\n\\nAt Fort Greely, Barth keeps close track of the moose population, describing the animals as his children. By his count, Fort Greely is home to a population of 55 to 75 moose, including about 40 on the missile field itself.\\n\\nThis is a denser population of moose than the average for the region, which Barth attributes to fences that surround the installation and to tasty ryegrass and oats planted on cleared lands on the base. In the winter, salted roads on the installation attract moose, bringing them into contact and sometimes conflict with residents, he said.\\n\\nLimited predation also accounts for the moose density, Barth said. A half-dozen grizzly bears frequent Fort Greely, but wolves are rare.\\n\\nBarth sees his help on the annual moose hunt as his own small but significant part of Fort Greely's national security mission. In addition to constantly training and being on guard for a possible missile launch from North Korea or another adversary, National Guardsmen at Fort Greely work to protect the perimeter of the missile field from attack. When wildlife wander onto the missile field too often, soldiers become less vigilant to security breaches.\\n\\n\\\"The moose can make people complacent,\\\" Barth said. \\\"My mission is that when they're ready to push the button (to launch a missile), there's nothing interfering.\\\"\\n\\nThe fog didn't lift while the party was at its breakfast of biscuits, gravy and scrambled eggs. Returning to the site where Galloway took his shot, Barth quickly walked into the woods and spotted a tuft of white moose hair where the moose had been standing.\\n\\nThere was no blood trail, so the group fanned out and started walking in the direction where the bull disappeared. They'd just gone a few steps when the antler of a bull moose popped out of the fog about 100 yards away. The bull was standing calmly and didn't appear especially distressed. Galloway had brought his rifle in case the moose needed a follow-up shot, but Barth told him not to raise it.\\n\\n\\\"That moose hasn't been shot,\\\" Barth said. \\\"That's a different one.\\\"\\n\\nThe party moved around the second moose and continued the search. After half an hour tromping around through the fog, they found no moose and no blood. They met back to regroup at the spot where Barth had found the moose hairs.\\n\\nThat's when Pentimone spotted an antler barely distinguishable from a tree stump on the ground.\\n\\nThe moose was down on its side, with its tongue hanging out the side of its mouth. The dead moose was right where the live moose they'd seen before had been standing, which is probably why they'd missed it.\\n\\nGalloway couldn't stop smiling as he stood over the moose to inspect it. The bull was a three-by-four, with three brow tines on one side and four on the other. Its antler spread was just more than 46 inches. The bull was just beginning to enter the mating season, and bits of velvet were still hanging from the antlers.\\n\\nGalloway worked carefully to cut the hide off the animal's shoulders so that a taxidermist can later make a mount.\\n\\nHis brother will have to wait for another moose to get his scrotum trophy. That part was left behind in the rush to get all the meat hauled out.\\n\\nThe fog that had hung around while they were searching for the moose abruptly gave way to bright sunlight as Galloway, Pentimone and an employee from Barth's office worked for the next six hours butchering the moose. Processed nearby at Delta Meat and Sausage Co., the moose produced more than 500 pounds of meat.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:08:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Fort Greely, Alaska\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"63.9412"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-145.57398"},"__v":0}

Boykin had four receptions for 84 yards in the game.\\n\\n\\\"I feel bad for our kids in the locker room,\\\" Narduzzi said. \\\"I'm disappointed for them. They fought their tails off. We were ahead almost the entire game. Sometimes you can't control what you can't control. We went toe-to-toe with a top-five team and we didn't pull it off in the end.\\\"\\n\\nBook and Boykin have connected for memorable plays before, including the 55-yard winning touchdown with 1:28 remaining in Notre Dame's 21-17 victory over LSU at the Citrus Bowl last season.\\n\\nPitt senior running tandem of Darrin Hall and Qadree Ollison rushed for 62 and 50 yards, respectively, with Ollison scoring the Panthers' first touchdown on a 9-yard run that capped a 17-play drive on their first possession of the game.\\n\\nKenny Pickett was 19 for 28 for 126 yards, and was sacked by Khalid Kareem - Notre Dame's only sack of the game - for a loss of 14 yards on Pitt's final possession to set up a fourth-and-long the Panthers could not convert.\\n\\nPitt also ran a strange faked punt on its second-to-last drive around midfield that failed.\\n\\nTAKEAWAYS\\n\\nPittsburgh: The Panthers gained just 12 yards on their last three drives of the first half. Their first, however, was a thing of beauty: 17 plays, 88 yards, six first downs, consuming 9:43 of the clock and ending with Ollison taking a direct snap, faking an end-around handoff and running into the end zone on second-and-goal from the Irish 9.\\n\\nNotre Dame: The Irish trailed for the first times after the first quarter (7-0), at halftime (7-6) and after three quarters (14-12), and they were their own worst enemy with turnovers, quarterback sacks and penalties at inopportune times. On Pitt's opening touchdown drive, the Panthers dropped back to punt on fourth-and-4 at their own 29, but Notre Dame jumped offside, giving the Panthers a first down that kept their drive alive.\\n\\nUPSET PANTHERS\\n\\nThis is the 11th time in the last 12 games between the two teams that the winning margin was in single digits. The Panthers won 28-21 in 2013 and 27-22 in 2009, both at home. Pitt last win at Notre Dame Stadium was a 36-33 four-overtime affair in 2008.\\n\\nThe Irish also prevailed at home 29-26 in triple overtime in 2012 in a game in which the Panthers missed a possible game-winning field goal in the second extra period.\\n\\nANEMIC IRISH\\n\\nNotre Dame, which entered the game averaging 195.7 yards (47th nationally), took a hit as Pittsburgh's front four held the Irish to just 80 yards on 38 carries. Notre Dame had a net gain of 124 yards but lost 32 of its 44 yards on three first-half quarterback sacks, 1.5 by Rashad Weaver.\\n\\nSenior Dexter Williams, who had gained 339 yards and rushed for four touchdowns in the two games since a university-imposed, four-game suspension, totaled just 31 yards on 13 carries. Book, who lost 35 yards rushing, also finished with 31 yards on 16 carries.\\n\\nThe Irish did not score a rushing touchdown for the first time this season.\\n\\nISN'T THAT (NOT) SPECIAL\\n\\nFor the second time this season, Notre Dame gave up a 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown when Ffrench opened the second half by burning the Irish. He found a seem in the middle and cut outside and eluded the tackle efforts of kicker Jonathan Doerer, Nicco Fertitta and Alohi Gilman to put the Panthers up 14-6.\\n\\nThe Irish gave up a 99-yard kickoff return to Michigan's Ambry Thomas during a season-opening 24-17 victory over the Wolverines.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nPittsburgh: Off next week and plays host to Duke Oct. 27.\\n\\nNotre Dame: Off next week and plays Navy in San Diego Oct. 27.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:05:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Indiana\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"40.00032"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-86.25027"},"__v":0}

Franks threw for 284 yards and two touchdowns. His second, an 11-yarder to Freddie Swain, padded the lead midway through the fourth quarter to seal the comeback.\\n\\nTAKEAWAYS\\n\\nFlorida: The Gators struggled yet again with too many penalties. The costliest came when they left the sideline while Vanderbilt trainers tended to lineman Dare Odeyingbo and coaches started yelling at each other. That unsportsmanlike conduct penalty wound up being the second for Joseph. The linebacker had been flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct on Vanderbilt's third TD drive for slamming a running back to the ground after the whistle.\\n\\nVanderbilt: The Commodores start 0-3 in league play for a sixth straight season. It didn't help that they lost running back Ke'Shawn Vaughn early in the second quarter to an unspecified injury. Vaughn finished with one catch for 75 yards and a TD , and he ran seven times for 56 yards before being hurt.\\n\\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\\n\\nThe Gators played sloppily enough with penalties and turnovers that holding their ranking will be good after their escape in Nashville.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nFlorida: The Gators have an open date before their annual game with No. 2 Georgia on Oct. 27.\\n\\nFollow Teresa M.

Now everybody wants to come in, and they come in illegally, and they use children. In many cases, the children aren't theirs. They grab them, and they want to come in with the children.\\\"\\n\\nThe president later added: \\\"You have really bad people coming in and using people. They're not their children. They don't even know the children. They haven't known the children for 20 minutes.

Senior administration officials noted, however, that they are not planning to revive the chaotic forced separations carried out by the Trump administration in May and June that spawned an enormous political backlash and led to a court order to reunite families.\\n\\nOne option under consideration, according to the report, is for the government to detain asylum-seeking families together for up to 20 days, then give parents a choice: Stay in family detention with their child for months or years as their immigration case proceeds, or allow children to be taken to a government shelter so other relatives or guardians can seek custody.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"47.50012"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-120.50147"},"__v":0}

If we had scored 1-0 it would have given the team confidence.\\\"\\n\\nGermany's woes were personified by Loew's decision to play Mark Uth as a lone striker despite the 27-year-old Schalke striker not scoring a goal yet this season. Uth rarely threatened and was substituted in the second half.\\n\\n\\\"He converted a lot of chances in training,\\\" Loew said to explain his decision to play Uth. \\\"But he had a difficult match here.\\\"\\n\\nLoew brought on Leroy Sane in the second half and the Manchester City forward looked dangerous attacking the Dutch on the left, but he also missed a clear chance to equalize in the 64th minute, firing wide when he had only goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen to beat.\\n\\n\\\"The young players were a breath of fresh air, but they missed a couple of good chances maybe because of their inexperience,\\\" Loew said.\\n\\nRonald Koeman's young Dutch team lost 2-1 to France in its opening Nations League match thanks to a goal by Kylian Mbappe and a stunning winner by Olivier Giroud. The Netherlands is second in the three-team group behind France, which drew 0-0 with Germany.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I'm proud,\\\" Koeman said. \\\"This is a fantastic result that we've been waiting for for a long time.\\\"\\n\\nKoeman is rebuilding the Netherlands after it failed to qualify for the last World Cup and European Championship. The country's only major trophy is the 1988 European Championship. The Dutch have reached three World Cup finals and lost them all.\\n\\nSo Koeman was still keen to improve even after Saturday's victory.\\n\\n\\\"We have to look at the moments that we can do better,\\\" said Koeman, who started with two debutants and brought on a third as a substitute during the match.\\n\\nCaptain Virgil van Dijk scored only his second international goal on the half hour and anchored a solid Dutch defense that held out Germany, while Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum struck late to achieve the historic win.\\n\\nThe comprehensive defeat left Germany at the bottom of Group 1 in the new competition's top-tier League A days before it heads to Paris to take on group leader and World Cup champion France.\\n\\nA corner from the right by Depay exposed German defensive frailties. Babel rose between Jonas Hector and Mats Hummels to head against the underside of the bar and the ball bounced up invitingly for unmarked Van Dijk to head in the opening goal.\\n\\nDepay doubled the lead in the 87th, calmly finishing after a quick break down the right by substitute Quincy Promes. The Olympique Lyon striker then hit the crossbar in extra time before Liverpool midfielder Wijnaldum made it 3-0 with virtually the last kick of the match as Germany crumbled.\\n\\nVan Dijk's opening goal came after the Netherlands had withstood strong pressure from Germany early on. Timo Werner and Jonas Hector on the right repeatedly caused problems for the Dutch defense.\\n\\nAfter initially struggling against Werner, debutant left back Denzel Dumfries showed his attacking qualities by twice swinging in dangerous crosses from the right, first for Ryan Babel who just failed to get a touch at the far post and then in the last minute of the first half for Depay whose glancing header went just wide of Manuel Neuer's right hand post.\\n\\nThe performance by the young Dutch team should give fans hope for the future, Koeman said.\\n\\n\\\"Take a look in five years,\\\" he said. \\\"I think you will see a much better team.\\\"\\n\\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T23:00:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Amsterdam\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"52.37403"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"4.88969"},"__v":0}

The story was \\\"another desperate lie by the defendant, which was completely inconsistent with any of the evidence that we had,\\\" Hirz said after the verdict.\\n\\nDawn Leombruno, Karen Leclair's niece, said after the verdict that it was difficult to hear stories about Leclair's treatment of his wife, who she said \\\"would do anything for anybody.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It doesn't bring her back, but at least we know she's getting justice now,\\\" said Leombruno, who lives in St. Petersburg, Florida.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T22:55:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Erie, Pennsylvania\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"42.12922"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-80.08506"},"__v":0}

He insisted he had only fingerprinted the sisters before taking them back to their cell.\\n\\nInvestigating the case came down to the sisters' word versus the agent's. And as in dozens of similar cases, government investigators sided with the agent.\\n\\nAdvocates say the case -- outlined in a report compiled by internal investigators -- shows the kinds of hurdles detained immigrants face when they make claims of misconduct, even when they come forward immediately, as the sisters did.\\n\\n\\\"These women were actually, for lack of a better word, lucky that their case was investigated,\\\" said Christina Mansfield, co-founder of the advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants. \\\"They are in the extreme minority in that regard.\\\"\\n\\nThe sisters, ages 17 and 19, entered the U.S. without legal permission in July 2016, several days after leaving their home village in Guatemala. They were detained by Border Patrol agents shortly after crossing the border.\\n\\nThe Associated Press received a redacted copy of the investigative report through the Freedom of Information Act. It shows that investigators determined that the sisters' allegations could not be substantiated due to a lack of physical evidence.\\n\\nThe station where the sisters were detained did not have cameras in the booking area. The room where the sisters say they were taken, later described as a supply room or a closet, wasn't processed for fingerprints because the sisters said they didn't touch anything. And the agent in question said he was alone with the sisters due to manpower shortages, the report says.\\n\\nImmigration advocates say the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, which reviewed the sisters' case, rarely recommends action against officers. A study by Freedom for Immigrants found that between January 2010 and July 2016, the inspector general received 84 complaints of coerced sexual contact against U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol. The inspector general opened just seven investigations, none of which are known to have led to charges, according to the study, which was conducted by examining government records.\\n\\nThe study found a similarly low number of cases were investigated by the inspector general for detention facilities operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nCBP would not directly address the sisters' case or whether it disciplined the agent involved. The agency said it was committed to treating detainees with \\\"professionalism and courtesy.\\\"\\n\\nImmigration authorities detain and process thousands of people every month who cross the U.S. border without permission. Border Patrol chief Carla Provost said in a recent interview that her agency takes any allegations against any of its 19,000 agents \\\"very, very seriously.\\\" Provost previously led CBP's internal affairs division, which also investigates allegations of employee wrongdoing and that the agency has taken steps to strengthen in recent years.\\n\\n\\\"They are very few and far between,\\\" she said, speaking generally about misconduct complaints.\\n\\nThe sisters were taken by agents to the Presidio Border Patrol station and booked into the same holding cell. The agents who detained them went out on another call.\\n\\nAccording to the report, a third agent then took the elder sister out of the cell. He told investigators that he processed and fingerprinted each of them before returning them to their cell.\\n\\nThe elder sister told a different story. She said the agent took her into a back room that had a table filled with snacks and drinks. There, she says, the agent told her to lift her sweater and dress. The woman said that after a small photograph fell out of her bra, the agent pulled up her bra. Then, she said, he told her to remove her pants and underwear, then touched her genitals with the outer part of his hand.\\n\\nThe younger sister would accuse the agent of conducting a similar search.\\n\\nBorder Patrol guidelines prohibit male agents to strip-search female detainees \\\"except in exigent circumstances,\\\" and only then with another agent present to observe. Under the guidelines, a vaginal cavity search must be done by a medical professional at a medical facility.\\n\\nWhen the agent later heard one of the sisters accusing him of misconduct, the report says, he \\\"became upset and told the girl he didn't make her do that.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to the investigators' report, one agent said that \\\"this is exactly the reason cameras are needed in the processing area.\\\"\\n\\nThe accused agent would speak to investigators three times. The last time, an investigator noted the agent \\\"appeared to be nervous and removed,\\\" and he \\\"had to constantly review a prepared statement\\\" from his initial interview. But a month after the last interview, investigators took their case to a federal prosecutor, James Miller, who agreed with their conclusion that there was a \\\"lack of evidence.\\\"\\n\\nMiller declined to comment on why he didn't pursue a prosecution. The agent did not return phone messages from The Associated Press, nor did his attorney, Raymond Martinez.\\n\\nThe sisters were eventually released and went to live with their mother in California.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc35c60ffe04444c46fbe02"},"title":"\"AP Explains: Harvard bias lawsuit heading to trial\"","body":"\"BOSTON -- A lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in Harvard University's admissions process is heading to trial in Boston's federal court.\\n\\nThe group Students for Fair Admissions has accused the Ivy League school of bias against Asian-American applicants, saying it holds them to a higher standard than students of other races.\\n\\nHarvard denies any discrimination and says it considers race as one of many factors when considering applicants.\\n\\nBoth sides will present their cases to U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs starting Monday.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2014 and carries implications for many other U.S. colleges that say they consider race to admit a diverse mix of students.\\n\\nThe case already has pulled back the curtain on aspects of Harvard's secretive admissions process, including a \\\"personal rating\\\" that measures certain character traits.\\n\\nStudents for Fair Admissions is a nonprofit led by Edward Blum, a legal strategist who argues schools should not consider race in admissions. The group is based in Arlington, Virginia, and says it has more than 20,000 members, including at least some Asian-Americans who were rejected from Harvard.\\n\\nBlum previously helped coordinate a lawsuit accusing the University of Texas of discriminating against white students. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and upheld the school's consideration of race in 2016.\\n\\nHarvard, one of the nation's most selective colleges, is defending the \\\"holistic\\\" review process it uses to pick from thousands of applicants a year. It considers factors from grades to geography, but also race, a tricky topic for a school that has struggled to reflect the nation's growing diversity.\\n\\nHarvard says it has made strides in that area but must be able to consider race in order to continue progress.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses Harvard of imposing tougher standards for Asian-American applicants and says it discriminates against them using a \\\"personal rating\\\" category.\\n\\nIt also alleges that Harvard practices \\\"racial balancing,\\\" saying the school works to maintain a certain distribution of each race on campus, which in past cases was ruled unconstitutional.\\n\\nThe group's case partly relies on an analysis of Harvard admissions records by Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono, who found that Asian-Americans bring the strongest academic records but are admitted at the lowest rate. He also found that while Asian-Americans receive strong personal rating scores from alumni interviewers, they are consistently dealt lower scores in that area from the admissions office.\\n\\nHarvard denies the accusations and says the group has failed to provide any concrete evidence of discrimination. University leaders say race is considered only in the narrow way that has been upheld in earlier Supreme Court cases, and they note that Harvard's share of Asian-Americans has grown in recent years, reaching 23 percent of the current freshman class.\\n\\nSchool officials see the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to build a diverse campus, and they vowed to defend the consideration of race for schools across the U.S.\\n\\nTheir defense partly relies on an analysis by David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination in Harvard's admissions records.\\n\\nThe case follows a series of previous lawsuits challenging whether colleges can consider the race of applicants, a practice which generally has been upheld. Dozens of schools continue to factor race into admissions and will closely watch to see if their own practices are deemed fair or could be put into jeopardy.\\n\\nFor observers, the case is expected to shine a light on Harvard's closely guarded admissions process. The judge allowed Harvard to redact many details from court documents, but they could be uncovered in trial testimony. There could be new revelations, for example, about preferences Harvard gives to children of alumni or donors, and a so-called \\\"Z-List\\\" that offers deferred admission to certain students who don't get in through the typical process.\\n\\nUltimately Harvard believes its campus diversity is at stake and says it couldn't achieve a rich mix of students without considering race. Its leaders also believe the suit threatens the flexibility that other courts have granted schools to build the type of student population that's best for their own campus.\\n\\nStudents for Fair Admissions believes the case could fix a system that places unfair weight on race, primarily at the expense of academically talented Asian Americans. The group's suit demands that Harvard make admissions decisions without any knowledge of students' race, and it asks for a broader ruling that the use of race in education is a civil rights violation.\\n\\nThe case is going to a bench trial, meaning it will be decided by a judge, not a jury. But the case isn't likely to end there. Whoever loses would be expected to appeal, potentially setting the stage for another Supreme Court case.\\n\\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkley\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T15:07:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Boston\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"42.35843"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-71.05977"},"__v":0}

While Democratic enthusiasm this year has largely been fueled by anger toward President Donald Trump,\\n\\ncandidates have targeted their messaging to focus more on health care.\\n\\nIt's the subject of the greatest share of political ads on television now, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, and a top issue in campaigns from Virginia to Arkansas to California -- and especially in Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema has made it the foundation of her Senate campaign against McSally.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats believe that health care is the issue that's going to deliver them the majority,\\\" said Nathan Gonzalez, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections. \\\"In 2016, Democrats learned that going all-in against Trump was not the right strategy, so they're trying to be more specific.\\\"\\n\\nThe Democratic furor around health care comes from Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans, including McSally, voted for a wide-ranging bill that would have, among other things, undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions and drastically changed and shrunk Medicaid. The Senate never took up the bill, and its own attempt to reverse the health care law failed by one vote.\\n\\nThis year, the Trump administration supported a group of GOP attorneys general who filed a lawsuit arguing the ACA is unconstitutional. The administration singled out protection for pre-existing conditions as unsustainable.\\n\\nDemocrats are effectively performing political judo on the GOP, who blistered them over four elections for messing up voters' health care with the Affordable Care Act and vowed a hasty repeal once they were back in power. Now that the GOP tried and failed to change health care, Democrats are pouncing.\\n\\n\\\"You see in every survey, whether it's a Senate race in a red state or a House race in a purple district, health care is the No. 1 issue,\\\" said Patrick McHugh of Priorities USA, a major Democratic campaign group. \\\"One party wants to actually expand health care coverage and reduce costs, and the other party campaigned claiming they did, but when they got into power, they did not.\\\"\\n\\nIn Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is defending her seat by highlighting that her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, signed onto the lawsuit over pre-existing conditions. In Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin aired an ad showing her mother dying of cancer and called incumbent Republican Rep.\\n\\nMike Bishop's vote for the GOP health bill \\\"dereliction of duty.\\\" In Arizona, Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, a physician, is running against Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko after shocking the political world by barely losing an April special election for the seat on a health care platform.\\n\\nGlen Bolger, a Republican pollster, notes that health care is a perennial Democratic base issue but acknowledges it appears especially potent this year. However, he said, Republicans have a possible counter -- pushing back against some Democrats' support for a single-payer system that would require higher taxes.\\n\\n\\\"That, as a pushback message, tests very well,\\\" Bolger said.\\n\\nRepublicans have used it in races where Democratic challengers have backed the policy -- such as against Katie Porter, an attorney challenging Republican Rep. Mimi Walters in Southern California, or against social worker Kara Eastman, who's leaned heavily on single payer in her challenge to Rep. Don Bacon in Nebraska. The GOP has even levied the charge against Democrats who haven't supported a single-payer program, like Abigail Spanberger, who's challenging Rep. David Brat in Virginia.\\n\\nGonzalez said the GOP responses show they're fighting on Democrats' turf and keeping the GOP from cashing in politically on the growing economy.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats believe that health care is the antidote to Republican talk about the economy,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe Arizona Senate contest provides a microcosm of the issue.\\n\\nDemocrats started hitting McSally on health care with an ad barrage from a dark-money group during the GOP primary and have not let up, accusing her of trying to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and charge older people more for health insurance.\\n\\nSinema mentions the issue everywhere she goes. In an interview with the Spanish-language Univision network Wednesday, she called it \\\"the centerpiece of my campaign.\\\"\\n\\nAt a recent appearance to rally volunteers in Scottsdale, Sinema was introduced by Leslie Foldy, a 64-year-old court reporter. \\\"I've had diabetes since high school. I've been taking insulin shots ... for the past 47 years,\\\" Foldy said.\\n\\nSinema picked up the theme and ran with it. \\\"We have a chance to elect a United States senator who understands Leslie's struggles to make sure she gets access to the important medication she needs and that she's not discriminated against because of having a pre-existing health condition,\\\" she said, adding a dig at the GOP health bill that McSally supported for containing what she calls an \\\"age tax\\\" -- a provision allowing insurance companies to charge people ages 50 to 64 who buy insurance on health exchanges rates five times higher than younger consumers. Under the ACA, the limit is three times higher.\\n\\nIn an interview, Sinema described her health care agenda as mainly a fight to preserve popular parts of the Affordable Care Act. She said she didn't like everything about the bill and noted she'd sponsored bills delaying or repealing some of its funding mechanisms -- taxes on medical devices and health insurance.\\n\\nMcSally instead focuses on the shortcomings of the law, blaming it for driving up health premiums for small businesses and other consumers and arguing Republicans are just trying to make things better. She bristles at the \\\"age tax\\\" attacks because she wrote an amendment adding $90 billion in subsidies for older consumers to protect against higher insurance rates. Although the GOP health bill did contain provisions that weakened the ACA's protections of pre-existing conditions, McSally calls pre-existing conditions \\\"a line in the sand\\\" that she'll protect.\\n\\n\\\"We've all got people in our lives who struggle with chronic disease,\\\" McSally said. \\\"It's personal for all of us. The Democrats are taking this line of attack because they know health care is personal.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T15:07:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Phoenix, Arizona\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"33.44838"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-112.07404"},"__v":0}

Burroughs starting Monday.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2014 and carries implications for many other U.S. colleges that say they consider race to admit a diverse mix of students.\\n\\nThe case already has pulled back the curtain on aspects of Harvard's secretive admissions process, including a \\\"personal rating\\\" that measures certain character traits.\\n\\nA look at the case and what to expect:\\n\\n___\\n\\nWHO'S INVOLVED?\\n\\nStudents for Fair Admissions is a nonprofit led by Edward Blum, a legal strategist who argues schools should not consider race in admissions. The group is based in Arlington, Virginia, and says it has more than 20,000 members, including at least some Asian-Americans who were rejected from Harvard.\\n\\nBlum previously helped coordinate a lawsuit accusing the University of Texas of discriminating against white students. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and upheld the school's consideration of race in 2016.\\n\\nHarvard, one of the nation's most selective colleges, is defending the \\\"holistic\\\" review process it uses to pick from thousands of applicants a year. It considers factors from grades to geography, but also race, a tricky topic for a school that has struggled to reflect the nation's growing diversity.\\n\\nHarvard says it has made strides in that area but must be able to consider race in order to continue progress.\\n\\n___\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE MAIN ARGUMENTS?\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses Harvard of imposing tougher standards for Asian-American applicants and says it discriminates against them using a \\\"personal rating\\\" category.\\n\\nIt also alleges that Harvard practices \\\"racial balancing,\\\" saying the school works to maintain a certain distribution of each race on campus, which in past cases was ruled unconstitutional.\\n\\nThe group's case partly relies on an analysis of Harvard admissions records by Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono, who found that Asian-Americans bring the strongest academic records but are admitted at the lowest rate. He also found that while Asian-Americans receive strong personal rating scores from alumni interviewers, they are consistently dealt lower scores in that area from the admissions office.\\n\\nHarvard denies the accusations and says the group has failed to provide any concrete evidence of discrimination. University leaders say race is considered only in the narrow way that has been upheld in earlier Supreme Court cases, and they note that Harvard's share of Asian-Americans has grown in recent years, reaching 23 percent of the current freshman class.\\n\\nSchool officials see the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to build a diverse campus, and they vowed to defend the consideration of race for schools across the U.S.\\n\\nTheir defense partly relies on an analysis by David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination in Harvard's admissions records.\\n\\n___\\n\\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\\n\\nThe case follows a series of previous lawsuits challenging whether colleges can consider the race of applicants, a practice which generally has been upheld. Dozens of schools continue to factor race into admissions and will closely watch to see if their own practices are deemed fair or could be put into jeopardy.\\n\\nFor observers, the case is expected to shine a light on Harvard's closely guarded admissions process. The judge allowed Harvard to redact many details from court documents, but they could be uncovered in trial testimony. There could be new revelations, for example, about preferences Harvard gives to children of alumni or donors, and a so-called \\\"Z-List\\\" that offers deferred admission to certain students who don't get in through the typical process.\\n\\nUltimately Harvard believes its campus diversity is at stake and says it couldn't achieve a rich mix of students without considering race. Its leaders also believe the suit threatens the flexibility that other courts have granted schools to build the type of student population that's best for their own campus.\\n\\nStudents for Fair Admissions believes the case could fix a system that places unfair weight on race, primarily at the expense of academically talented Asian Americans. The group's suit demands that Harvard make admissions decisions without any knowledge of students' race, and it asks for a broader ruling that the use of race in education is a civil rights violation.\\n\\nThe case is going to a bench trial, meaning it will be decided by a judge, not a jury. But the case isn't likely to end there. Whoever loses would be expected to appeal, potentially setting the stage for another Supreme Court case.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T15:05:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Boston\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"42.35843"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-71.05977"},"__v":0}

That plan was later approved by the House, but the Senate has not taken it up.\\n\\nPointing to Florida's close statewide races in the last two election cycles, Hill said Florida's ballot initiative would force candidates in both parties to compete for a large number of new voters in a state where Republicans have held a narrow advantage in recent years.\\n\\nDeSantis has not weighed in on whether he supports Amendment 4. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum is an outspoken proponent.\\n\\n\\\"Florida knows how to have very tight elections... you have to fight for every vote,\\\" said Hill, who supports Gillum in the governor's race. \\\"I don't believe that any party should take for granted for any vote, and those 1.3 million people who come into the fray... will take this [seriously].\\\"\\n\\nAlso on this episode of Beyond the Bubble, Fort Worth Star-Telegram's Bud Kennedy says Texas voters, who typically check out after the primaries, are gearing up for an unusually competitive fall election.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T15:05:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Washington (state)\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"47.50012"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-120.50147"},"__v":0}

But Newtown's Jeff Garrity made an interception and returned 30 yards to midfield. After Newtown quarterback Luis Melillo passed 25 yards to NFA's 20, Devin O'Connell kicked a 37-yard field goal to make it, 24-14.\\n\\nMissed opportunities and miscues turned the game into a blowout in the second half.\\n\\n\\\"You can't make the mistakes we did and stay in the game,\\\" Bakoulis said. \\\"There were a lot of opportunities out there for us, but we didn't do our job of taking care of the ball and executing every play. You've got to finish.\\\"\\n\\nThe Wildcats ultimately could not contain Newtown's 220-pound tailback Dan Mason (26 carries for 186 yards, 3 TDs) nor Melillo, who passed for 150 yards and rushed for 90 and three touchdowns. The turnovers, failed conversions and key penalties were crippling, turning a competitive 20 minutes of football when the game was tied at 14 into running clock after Newtown took a 51-14 lead with four minutes left.\\n\\n\\\"I thought NFA was giving us the competition we hadn't had in our first four games,\\\" Newtown coach Bob Pattison said. \\\"We capitalized on turnovers and controlled the ball behind our offensive line.\\\"\\n\\nThe storyline of execution and mistakes started early. Melillo scrambled 15 yards on 4th and 5 on the Nighthawks' first series to sustain a 61-yard scoring drive, ending on Mason's 4-yard run to make it, 7-0.\\n\\nNFA answered with a 75-yard scoring drive on Elijah Parker's 12-yard TD run to tie it at 7-7.\\n\\nThe Wildcats forced Newtown to punt on the next possession but jumped offsides on 4th-and-5 to keep a drive going, resulting in Mason's 12-yard TD run to make it, 14-7, with 1:38 left.\\n\\nA terrific first quarter was not quite over. Parker hit Andrew Cote with a 57-yard pass. Cote was stripped of the ball near the goal-line, but Wildcat teammate Kevin Pomroy recovered in the end zone to tie the score at 14-14 with seconds left in the first.\\n\\nMason ran seven times for 45 yards in a 55-yard scoring march before Melillo ran in from 10 yards out to make give the visitors a 21-14 edge with 8:20 left.\\n\\n\\\"NFA played hard and gave us more of a challenge than anyone in our first four games,\\\" Mason said. \\\"As it turned out, it was well worth making the two-hour trip here.\\\"\\n\\nNFA took the second half kickoff and drove to the Newtown 35 before Parker was stopped short on 4th-and-1. Newtown (5-0)answered with a 10-play drive, scoring on Mason's 4-yard run to make it, 31-14, with 4:39 left.\\n\\nThe Wildcats continued to move the ball offensively, particularly through the air, but a fumbled handoff exchange gave Newtown the ball on its 15. Mason carried seven times for 50 yards on the 85-yard drive, and Melillo scored his second TD on a 3-yard run for a 37-14 lead with 8:22 left to play.\\n\\nNewtown's Will Swierbut intercepted a tipped Parker pass. Melillo tacked on his third TD, a 32-yarder, for a 44-14 lead. Backup running back added an 88-yard run against a clearly discouraged NFA defense with 2:47 left for the final 51-14 score.\\n\\n\\\"We looked at this as a business trip,\\\" Pattison said. \\\"We usually don't play this far from home and we normally don't play Saturday. We did what we had to do.\\\"\\n\\nIn past seasons, NFA would have played a smaller ECC school and likely would have overmatched it. The WIldcats, who play WIndsor next week, welcome the challenge of playing top competition.\\n\\n\\\"You get better when you play the best,\\\" Bakoulis said, \\\"but you've got to execute, which we didn't do today.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T15:04:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Norwich\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"52.62783"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"1.29834"},"__v":0}

As a native of the Toronto area, Laughton also finds himself around the Maple Leafs, Marlies and a couple of their coaching consultants like skills gurus Mike Ellis and Darryl Belfry.\\n\\nHis work in the offseason earned him an invite into an exclusive club, a training session in Florida that, according to a recent Sports Illustrated story, Belfry named \\\"The 88 Summit\\\" after Patrick Kane who dons the number for the Chicago Blackhawks. Included in the events was a video session where players like Kane, Claude Giroux, Shayne Gostisbehere, Auston Matthews and Dylan Larkin all broke down some of their plays, explaining why and how they made the moves they did.\\n\\n\\\"I was lucky enough to go to that camp in Florida with G and Ghost,\\\" Laughton said. \\\"I think that definitely helped. They're definitely intertwined, the skill guy and the coach that I work with and the skating coach that I work with. It all comes together.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was a camp to kind of work on some things. It's a different look to what you've been thinking,\\\" Giroux added. \\\"I think it was good for him. Mentally, I think you saw him come into camp with more confidence. He's just making plays out there. He's skating well and he's got a great attitude.\\\"\\n\\nSo far, Laughton has been one of the better Flyers this season. Considering he gets about five fewer minutes a night than Giroux to show what he can do, it's an impressive feat. He has three goals in five games, has a big role on the penalty kill and has won eight of 14 faceoffs.\\n\\nLaughton was a 2012 first-round pick, a center for the Oshawa Generals who yo-yoed for six seasons after the Flyers drafted him. He made the NHL roster for five games after the 2012 lockout ended, when he was mid-season with the Generals. He then played six games in the American Hockey League for the Adirondack Phantoms when the Generals were done, went back to Oshawa the following season and was a first-team Ontario Hockey League All-Star.\\n\\nLast season was his second full campaign in the NHL. He spent all but two games of the 2016-17 season with the Phantoms, being groomed for the fourth-line center role. He did that last season for the Flyers and now finds himself at left wing.\\n\\nThere was a time not too long ago that he would go back to center in the absence of Nolan Patrick. Instead the Flyers like him on the left side enough to keep him there. Jordan Weal filled the role Saturday instead.\\n\\n\\\"I felt comfortable there (on the wing) and a lot less work in the D-zone (than centers are required),\\\" Laughton said. \\\"A lot more energy in the offensive zone once you get in there.\\n\\n\\\"You're up at the wing and once we get the puck we've got a lot of leeway to take off and get going. I've enjoyed it there. Just got to continue to grow in that role as a winger. I'm still learning. I'm still new at it and I'm still trying to get better every day to become a better winger.\\\"\\n\\nLaughton, at the ripe age of 24, has already seen a lot.\\n\\nHe's been in the minors, slumming it on the bus instead of the chartered flight. He tasted what the NHL is like at age 18 before he had finished his last two years of junior hockey. A lot of players get stuck somewhere in between and some that get demoted to the AHL never make it back.\\n\\nHe has and he's thriving.\\n\\n\\\"If you give up, there's no chance you're getting back,\\\" Laughton said. \\\"You gotta get better as a player down there. You can't mope about it. You've just got to go to work and get better to get back at this level.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's grown up. He's a mature kid now,\\\" general manager Ron Hextall added. \\\"I don't know if I can say that a few years ago. He understands his role. He understands his strengths and he plays to his strengths. Sometimes kids come out of junior and they dominate at the junior level and they all expect to dominate here and it's not that easy. I think Scotty's playing to his strengths and playing extremely well for us.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T15:04:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Voorhees Township, New Jersey\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"40.48122"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-74.48321"},"__v":0}

And the agent in question said he was alone with the sisters due to manpower shortages, the report says.\\n\\nImmigration advocates say the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, which reviewed the sisters' case, rarely recommends action against officers. A study by Freedom for Immigrants found that between January 2010 and July 2016, the inspector general received 84 complaints of coerced sexual contact against U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol. The inspector general opened just seven investigations, none of which are known to have led to charges, according to the study, which was conducted by examining government records.\\n\\nThe study found a similarly low number of cases were investigated by the inspector general for detention facilities operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nCBP would not directly address the sisters' case or whether it disciplined the agent involved.

Border Patrol chief Carla Provost said in a recent interview that her agency takes any allegations against any of its 19,000 agents \\\"very, very seriously.\\\" Provost previously led CBP's internal affairs division, which also investigates allegations of employee wrongdoing and that the agency has taken steps to strengthen in recent years.\\n\\n\\\"They are very few and far between,\\\" she said, speaking generally about misconduct complaints.\\n\\nThe sisters were taken by agents to the Presidio Border Patrol station and booked into the same holding cell. The agents who detained them went out on another call.\\n\\nAccording to the report, a third agent then took the elder sister out of the cell. He told investigators that he processed and fingerprinted each of them before returning them to their cell.\\n\\nThe elder sister told a different story. She said the agent took her into a back room that had a table filled with snacks and drinks. There, she says, the agent told her to lift her sweater and dress. The woman said that after a small photograph fell out of her bra, the agent pulled up her bra. Then, she said, he told her to remove her pants and underwear, then touched her genitals with the outer part of his hand.\\n\\nThe younger sister would accuse the agent of conducting a similar search.\\n\\nBorder Patrol guidelines prohibit male agents to strip-search female detainees \\\"except in exigent circumstances,\\\" and only then with another agent present to observe.

The last time, an investigator noted the agent \\\"appeared to be nervous and removed,\\\" and he \\\"had to constantly review a prepared statement\\\" from his initial interview. But a month after the last interview, investigators took their case to a federal prosecutor, James Miller, who agreed with their conclusion that there was a \\\"lack of evidence.\\\"\\n\\nMiller declined to comment on why he didn't pursue a prosecution.

The group is based in Arlington, Virginia, and says it has more than 20,000 members, including at least some Asian-Americans who were rejected from Harvard.\\n\\nBlum previously helped coordinate a lawsuit accusing the University of Texas of discriminating against white students. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and upheld the school's consideration of race in 2016.\\n\\nHarvard, one of the nation's most selective colleges, is defending the \\\"holistic\\\" review process it uses to pick from thousands of applicants a year. It considers factors from grades to geography, but also race, a tricky topic for a school that has struggled to reflect the nation's growing diversity.\\n\\nHarvard says it has made strides in that area but must be able to consider race in order to continue progress.\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE MAIN ARGUMENTS?\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses Harvard of imposing tougher standards for Asian-American applicants and says it discriminates against them using a \\\"personal rating\\\" category.\\n\\nIt also alleges that Harvard practices \\\"racial balancing,\\\" saying the school works to maintain a certain distribution of each race on campus, which in past cases was ruled unconstitutional.\\n\\nThe group's case partly relies on an analysis of Harvard admissions records by Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono, who found that Asian-Americans bring the strongest academic records but are admitted at the lowest rate. He also found that while Asian-Americans receive strong personal rating scores from alumni interviewers, they are consistently dealt lower scores in that area from the admissions office.\\n\\nHarvard denies the accusations and says the group has failed to provide any concrete evidence of discrimination.

Dozens of schools continue to factor race into admissions and will closely watch to see if their own practices are deemed fair or could be put into jeopardy.\\n\\nFor observers, the case is expected to shine a light on Harvard's closely guarded admissions process. The judge allowed Harvard to redact many details from court documents, but they could be uncovered in trial testimony. There could be new revelations, for example, about preferences Harvard gives to children of alumni or donors, and a so-called \\\"Z-List\\\" that offers deferred admission to certain students who don't get in through the typical process.\\n\\nUltimately Harvard believes its campus diversity is at stake and says it couldn't achieve a rich mix of students without considering race. Its leaders also believe the suit threatens the flexibility that other courts have granted schools to build the type of student population that's best for their own campus.\\n\\nStudents for Fair Admissions believes the case could fix a system that places unfair weight on race, primarily at the expense of academically talented Asian Americans. The group's suit demands that Harvard make admissions decisions without any knowledge of students' race, and it asks for a broader ruling that the use of race in education is a civil rights violation.\\n\\nThe case is going to a bench trial, meaning it will be decided by a judge, not a jury.

While Democratic enthusiasm this year has largely been fueled by anger toward President Donald Trump, candidates have targeted their messaging to focus more on health care.\\n\\nIt's the subject of the greatest share of political ads on television now, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, and a top issue in campaigns from Virginia to Arkansas to California -- and especially in Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema has made it the foundation of her Senate campaign against McSally.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats believe that health care is the issue that's going to deliver them the majority,\\\" said Nathan Gonzalez, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections. \\\"In 2016, Democrats learned that going all-in against Trump was not the right strategy, so they're trying to be more specific.\\\"\\n\\nThe Democratic furor around health care comes from Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans, including McSally, voted for a wide-ranging bill that would have, among other things, undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions and drastically changed and shrunk Medicaid. The Senate never took up the bill, and its own attempt to reverse the health care law failed by one vote.\\n\\nThis year, the Trump administration supported a group of GOP attorneys general who filed a lawsuit arguing the ACA is unconstitutional. The administration singled out protection for pre-existing conditions as unsustainable.\\n\\nDemocrats are effectively performing political judo on the GOP, who blistered them over four elections for messing up voters' health care with the Affordable Care Act and vowed a hasty repeal once they were back in power. Now that the GOP tried and failed to change health care, Democrats are pouncing.\\n\\n\\\"You see in every survey, whether it's a Senate race in a red state or a House race in a purple district, health care is the No. 1 issue,\\\" said Patrick McHugh of Priorities USA, a major Democratic campaign group. \\\"One party wants to actually expand health care coverage and reduce costs, and the other party campaigned claiming they did, but when they got into power, they did not.\\\"\\n\\nIn Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is defending her seat by highlighting that her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, signed onto the lawsuit over pre-existing conditions. In Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin aired an ad showing her mother dying of cancer and called incumbent Republican Rep. Mike Bishop's vote for the GOP health bill \\\"dereliction of duty.\\\" In Arizona, Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, a physician, is running against Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko after shocking the political world by barely losing an April special election for the seat on a health care platform.\\n\\nGlen Bolger, a Republican pollster, notes that health care is a perennial Democratic base issue but acknowledges it appears especially potent this year. However, he said, Republicans have a possible counter -- pushing back against some Democrats' support for a single-payer system that would require higher taxes.\\n\\n\\\"That, as a pushback message, tests very well,\\\" Bolger said.\\n\\nRepublicans have used it in races where Democratic challengers have backed the policy -- such as against Katie Porter, an attorney challenging Republican Rep. Mimi Walters in Southern California, or against social worker Kara Eastman, who's leaned heavily on single payer in her challenge to Rep. Don Bacon in Nebraska. The GOP has even levied the charge against Democrats who haven't supported a single-payer program, like Abigail Spanberger, who's challenging Rep. David Brat in Virginia.\\n\\nGonzalez said the GOP responses show they're fighting on Democrats' turf and keeping the GOP from cashing in politically on the growing economy.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats believe that health care is the antidote to Republican talk about the economy,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe Arizona Senate contest provides a microcosm of the issue. Democrats started hitting McSally on health care with an ad barrage from a dark-money group during the GOP primary and have not let up, accusing her of trying to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and charge older people more for health insurance. Sinema mentions the issue everywhere she goes. In an interview with the Spanish-language Univision network Wednesday, she called it \\\"the centerpiece of my campaign.\\\"\\n\\nAt a recent appearance to rally volunteers in Scottsdale, Sinema was introduced by Leslie Foldy, a 64-year-old court reporter. \\\"I've had diabetes since high school. I've been taking insulin shots ... for the past 47 years,\\\" Foldy said.\\n\\nSinema picked up the theme and ran with it. \\\"We have a chance to elect a United States senator who understands Leslie's struggles to make sure she gets access to the important medication she needs and that she's not discriminated against because of having a pre-existing health condition,\\\" she said, adding a dig at the GOP health bill that McSally supported for containing what she calls an \\\"age tax\\\" -- a provision allowing insurance companies to charge people ages 50 to 64 who buy insurance on health exchanges rates five times higher than younger consumers. Under the ACA, the limit is three times higher.\\n\\nIn an interview, Sinema described her health care agenda as mainly a fight to preserve popular parts of the Affordable Care Act. She said she didn't like everything about the bill and noted she'd sponsored bills delaying or repealing some of its funding mechanisms -- taxes on medical devices and health insurance.\\n\\nMcSally instead focuses on the shortcomings of the law, blaming it for driving up health premiums for small businesses and other consumers and arguing Republicans are just trying to make things better. She bristles at the \\\"age tax\\\" attacks because she wrote an amendment adding $90 billion in subsidies for older consumers to protect against higher insurance rates. Although the GOP health bill did contain provisions that weakened the ACA's protections of pre-existing conditions, McSally calls pre-existing conditions \\\"a line in the sand\\\" that she'll protect.\\n\\n\\\"We've all got people in our lives who struggle with chronic disease,\\\" McSally said. \\\"It's personal for all of us. The Democrats are taking this line of attack because they know health care is personal.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:57:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Phoenix, Arizona\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"33.44838"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-112.07404"},"__v":0}

(AP) -- Guards and inmates at a Connecticut prison find themselves same side of a legal fight against the state, which they say did not do enough to prevent their exposure to radon.\\n\\nA federal judge last month ruled against the state's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit by 13 inmates inside the Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown. They allege Correction Department officials exposed them to high levels of the radioactive gas, creating unconstitutional and inhumane conditions of confinement inside the maximum-security prison.\\n\\nA separate lawsuit was filed in state court in August by 16 former guards and staff members, several of whom suffer from respiratory ailments. It asserts the staff should have been informed of the radon problem.\\n\\n\\\"They told the current guards, but they didn't tell the retirees,\\\" said Lori Welch-Rubin, an attorney who finds herself in the unusual position of representing both prisoners and their former guards. \\\"There was one gentleman who found out two years later that he had Stage 4 lung cancer and died four months after the diagnoses. Had he known to get tested, they could have caught it earlier and saved his life.\\\"\\n\\nFrank Crose, who served as warden between 1992 and 1996, became the lead plaintiff after being diagnosed with nodules on his lungs.\\n\\nWelch-Rubin alleges the state knew about the potential for problems with radon at Garner when it was opened in 1992 but did not begin testing until 2013, when it was requested by a teacher at the prison's school. The state has required radon testing at all schools since 2003, she said.\\n\\nThose tests found extremely high levels of radon inside the classrooms, which are on the second floor, she said.\\n\\n\\\"We're talking about levels in some places that are equivalent to smoking 2 ½ packs of cigarettes a day,\\\" she said. \\\"Not just being exposed to smoke, actually smoking 2 ½ packs a day.\\\"\\n\\nConnecticut Correction Department spokesman Andrius Banevicius said the state now routinely tests for radon in the prison and recently completed the installation of a radon mitigation system there.\\n\\nThe state, he said, is reviewing the Sept. 27 decision by U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton, which rejected the state's attempt to have the federal lawsuit dismissed based on claims of qualified and sovereign immunity.\\n\\nWelch-Rubin asserts the mitigation system doesn't cover all areas of the prison and used pipes that were too small to properly vent the gas, which is naturally occurring and seeps into the prison from the surrounding bedrock. She plans to seek class-action status for the lawsuit on behalf of all inmates who have been housed at Garner.\\n\\nAfter the 2013 testing, she said, current guards were told to get a baseline chest X-ray and file forms that would allow them to seek workers compensation if they develop health problems in the future.\\n\\n\\\"They still haven't tested where the prisoners are,\\\" she said, \\\"so we don't know if what they are now doing is even adequate.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:57:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Hartford, Connecticut\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.76371"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-72.68509"},"__v":0}

The fish are a critical piece of the ecosystem in the eastern states, where they serve as food for birds and larger fish.\\n\\nThe comeback is most noticeable in Maine, the state with by far the largest river herring fishery in the country. Maine fishermen capture alewives, a species of river herring, and their catch of nearly 1.7 million pounds last year was the second largest in the last 37 years.\\n\\n\\\"The stocks in Maine in the last three years have rocketed up,\\\" said state Rep. Jeffrey Pierce, a Republican lawmaker and the head of the Alewife Harvesters of Maine. \\\"Years ago, we couldn't have predicted.\\\"\\n\\nHerring spend most of their lives at sea, returning to freshwater to spawn in the spring. The fish's populations dramatically fell after generations of damming, habitat loss and overfishing. The federal government considered adding the fish to the endangered list before deciding against it in 2013.\\n\\nFishing for river herring was one of the earlier industries in colonial America, and annual catches of more than 50 million pounds were common up through the 1960s. Those numbers fell to about 1 million pounds per year in the mid-1990s, causing commercial catch to plummet through the 2000s.\\n\\nBut a 2017 assessment of 54 river herring stocks found that 16 experienced trends of increasing abundance and only two showed a declining trend, said Tina Berger, a spokeswoman for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Others were either stable, showed no trends or didn't produce enough data, she said.\\n\\n\\\"While abundance in these river systems are still at low levels, dam removals and improvements to fish passage have had a positive impact on run returns,\\\" she said.\\n\\nWhile river herring are not as commonly used as food for humans as they were centuries ago, they remain fished commercially as a source of bait. Maine has fewer than 20 commercial river herring fishermen, who fish for alewives in rivers every spring, sometimes using gear that is more than a century old.\\n\\nThe fish are entrenched in the culture of coastal Maine, where the town of Nobleboro retains an ancient law that widows can apply for two bushels of alewives.\\n\\nThe fish's comeback, and the slight uptick in catch, has spurred calls for conservative management from environmental groups, which have long advocated for removal of dams to help bring back the river herring population.\\n\\nThe federal government's consideration of adding river herring to the endangered species list was spurred by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 2011. Brad Sewell, who oversees fisheries work for the council, said warming waters off New England remain an \\\"extinction event waiting to happen\\\" for this fish.\\n\\n\\\"It's concerning to me that people, and to some degree government officials, are trumpeting this limited success in Maine as being indicative of what's going on with river herring coast-wide,\\\" he said. \\\"That's simply not the case.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:55:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Portland, Maine\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"43.66147"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-70.25533"},"__v":0}

(AP) -- Mary Frances Parrish is expecting to be without electricity for weeks, or roughly the same time the terminally ill son she's caring for is expected to live.\\n\\nIn the days after Hurricane Michael smashed through her neighborhood, leaving many of her neighbors' homes destroyed, she and her son Derrell, 47, were planning to stay, with or without running water and electricity. The reason is the same she waited out the storm in the tiny house: She doesn't have a running car and she doesn't know where she would go.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't have a way of getting away from here. My car's under repair and there's nowhere to go or the money to pay for a place,\\\" the 72-year-old Parrish said. \\\"People are sending stuff in. I've got plenty of water, I've got cold drinks, I've got plenty to eat. It may be right out of the can, but it's plenty to eat. As long as you can have plenty to eat and drink and stay in good spirits, you'll make it.\\\"\\n\\nParrish, whose son has cancer, is in a position many in the Panama City region are facing. They have damaged homes, no power, and don't have the resources to relocate, either to a new home or a temporary home. While others with more means have gobbled up hotel rooms in Destin 45 miles to the west, there are many who now no longer have a job and are forced to stay in damaged homes.\\n\\nAround the corner from Parrish, Nanya Thompson, 68, was hanging clothes to dry from the power lines that were now dangling a couple of feet off the ground directly in front of her apartment door. All but two of the windows of the small home were blown out during the storm, and part of the roof came off, blowing water and insulation into it.\\n\\nShe was a hotel worker, but the hotel she worked at was damaged during the storm and now her job is gone.

Water gushed in, but he said they're staying.\\n\\nMoseley, who lost his right leg below the knee in a car accident, was sweaty and tired as he tried to clean up. But he doesn't have a job and he said he and his mother are staying in the house in a particularly hard-hit neighborhood.\\n\\n\\\"Where the hell do you go?,\\\" he said. \\\"I survive. I got one leg. I survive ... I don't have nothing. I ain't going nowhere.\\\"\\n\\nA few streets down, Gay Little, 72, returned to her home to gather her belongings with the help of her daughter-in-law. She stayed with her son and his family during the storm further north in Bay County, but came back to find her home unlivable. Before the storm, she had decorated her yard with a lively Christmas in October display. Now ornaments and plastic Santas were blown into surrounding yards while figurines were scattered around her home.\\n\\nLittle lives alone in the house.

The agent...\"","body":"\"HOUSTON -- Within hours of being booked at a Border Patrol station in far West Texas, two teenage sisters from Guatemala came forward to allege that an agent conducted an improper strip search.\\n\\nThe agent in question denied the allegations, including the sisters' claims that he touched their genitals. He insisted he had only fingerprinted the sisters before taking them back to their cell.\\n\\nInvestigating the case came down to the sisters' word versus the agent's. And as in dozens of similar cases, government investigators sided with the agent.\\n\\nAdvocates say the case -- outlined in a report compiled by internal investigators -- shows the kinds of hurdles detained immigrants face when they make claims of misconduct, even when they come forward immediately, as the sisters did.\\n\\n\\\"These women were actually, for lack of a better word, lucky that their case was investigated,\\\" said Christina Mansfield, co-founder of the advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants. \\\"They are in the extreme minority in that regard.\\\"\\n\\nThe sisters, ages 17 and 19, entered the U.S. without legal permission in July 2016, several days after leaving their home village in Guatemala. They were detained by Border Patrol agents shortly after crossing the border.\\n\\nThe Associated Press received a redacted copy of the investigative report through the Freedom of Information Act. It shows that investigators determined that the sisters' allegations could not be substantiated due to a lack of physical evidence.\\n\\nThe station where the sisters were detained did not have cameras in the booking area. The room where the sisters say they were taken, later described as a supply room or a closet, wasn't processed for fingerprints because the sisters said they didn't touch anything. And the agent in question said he was alone with the sisters due to manpower shortages, the report says.\\n\\nImmigration advocates say the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, which reviewed the sisters' case, rarely recommends action against officers. A study by Freedom for Immigrants found that between January 2010 and July 2016, the inspector general received 84 complaints of coerced sexual contact against U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol. The inspector general opened just seven investigations, none of which are known to have led to charges, according to the study, which was conducted by examining government records.\\n\\nThe study found a similarly low number of cases were investigated by the inspector general for detention facilities operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nCBP would not directly address the sisters' case or whether it disciplined the agent involved. The agency said it was committed to treating detainees with \\\"professionalism and courtesy.\\\"\\n\\nImmigration authorities detain and process thousands of people every month who cross the U.S. border without permission. Border Patrol chief Carla Provost said in a recent interview that her agency takes any allegations against any of its 19,000 agents \\\"very, very seriously.\\\" Provost previously led CBP's internal affairs division, which also investigates allegations of employee wrongdoing and that the agency has taken steps to strengthen in recent years.\\n\\n\\\"They are very few and far between,\\\" she said, speaking generally about misconduct complaints.\\n\\nThe sisters were taken by agents to the Presidio Border Patrol station and booked into the same holding cell. The agents who detained them went out on another call.\\n\\nAccording to the report, a third agent then took the elder sister out of the cell. He told investigators that he processed and fingerprinted each of them before returning them to their cell.\\n\\nThe elder sister told a different story. She said the agent took her into a back room that had a table filled with snacks and drinks. There, she says, the agent told her to lift her sweater and dress. The woman said that after a small photograph fell out of her bra, the agent pulled up her bra. Then, she said, he told her to remove her pants and underwear, then touched her genitals with the outer part of his hand.\\n\\nThe younger sister would accuse the agent of conducting a similar search.\\n\\nBorder Patrol guidelines prohibit male agents to strip-search female detainees \\\"except in exigent circumstances,\\\" and only then with another agent present to observe. Under the guidelines, a vaginal cavity search must be done by a medical professional at a medical facility.\\n\\nWhen the agent later heard one of the sisters accusing him of misconduct, the report says, he \\\"became upset and told the girl he didn't make her do that.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to the investigators' report, one agent said that \\\"this is exactly the reason cameras are needed in the processing area.\\\"\\n\\nThe accused agent would speak to investigators three times. The last time, an investigator noted the agent \\\"appeared to be nervous and removed,\\\" and he \\\"had to constantly review a prepared statement\\\" from his initial interview. But a month after the last interview, investigators took their case to a federal prosecutor, James Miller, who agreed with their conclusion that there was a \\\"lack of evidence.\\\"\\n\\nMiller declined to comment on why he didn't pursue a prosecution. The agent did not return phone messages from The Associated Press, nor did his attorney, Raymond Martinez.\\n\\nThe sisters were eventually released and went to live with their mother in California. One of the sisters has since sued the U.S. government. Court filings show both sides are now discussing a settlement.\\n\\nLauer reported from Philadelphia.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc35c60ffe04444c46fbe44"},"title":"\"AP Explains: Harvard bias lawsuit heading to trial\"","body":"\"BOSTON -- FOR SUNDAY\\n\\nA lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in Harvard University's admissions process is heading to trial in Boston's federal court.\\n\\nThe group Students for Fair Admissions has accused the Ivy League school of bias against Asian-American applicants, saying it holds them to a higher standard than students of other races.\\n\\nHarvard denies any discrimination and says it considers race as one of many factors when considering applicants.\\n\\nBoth sides will present their cases to U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs starting Monday.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2014 and carries implications for many other U.S. colleges that say they consider race to admit a diverse mix of students.\\n\\nThe case already has pulled back the curtain on aspects of Harvard's secretive admissions process, including a \\\"personal rating\\\" that measures certain character traits.\\n\\nA look at the case and what to expect:\\n\\nWHO'S INVOLVED?\\n\\nStudents for Fair Admissions is a nonprofit led by Edward Blum, a legal strategist who argues schools should not consider race in admissions. The group is based in Arlington, Virginia, and says it has more than 20,000 members, including at least some Asian-Americans who were rejected from Harvard.\\n\\nBlum previously helped coordinate a lawsuit accusing the University of Texas of discriminating against white students. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and upheld the school's consideration of race in 2016.\\n\\nHarvard, one of the nation's most selective colleges, is defending the \\\"holistic\\\" review process it uses to pick from thousands of applicants a year. It considers factors from grades to geography, but also race, a tricky topic for a school that has struggled to reflect the nation's growing diversity.\\n\\nHarvard says it has made strides in that area but must be able to consider race in order to continue progress.\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE MAIN ARGUMENTS?\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses Harvard of imposing tougher standards for Asian-American applicants and says it discriminates against them using a \\\"personal rating\\\" category.\\n\\nIt also alleges that Harvard practices \\\"racial balancing,\\\" saying the school works to maintain a certain distribution of each race on campus, which in past cases was ruled unconstitutional.\\n\\nThe group's case partly relies on an analysis of Harvard admissions records by Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono, who found that Asian-Americans bring the strongest academic records but are admitted at the lowest rate. He also found that while Asian-Americans receive strong personal rating scores from alumni interviewers, they are consistently dealt lower scores in that area from the admissions office.\\n\\nHarvard denies the accusations and says the group has failed to provide any concrete evidence of discrimination. University leaders say race is considered only in the narrow way that has been upheld in earlier Supreme Court cases, and they note that Harvard's share of Asian-Americans has grown in recent years, reaching 23 percent of the current freshman class.\\n\\nSchool officials see the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to build a diverse campus, and they vowed to defend the consideration of race for schools across the U.S.\\n\\nTheir defense partly relies on an analysis by David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination in Harvard's admissions records.\\n\\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\\n\\nThe case follows a series of previous lawsuits challenging whether colleges can consider the race of applicants, a practice which generally has been upheld. Dozens of schools continue to factor race into admissions and will closely watch to see if their own practices are deemed fair or could be put into jeopardy.\\n\\nFor observers, the case is expected to shine a light on Harvard's closely guarded admissions process. The judge allowed Harvard to redact many details from court documents, but they could be uncovered in trial testimony. There could be new revelations, for example, about preferences Harvard gives to children of alumni or donors, and a so-called \\\"Z-List\\\" that offers deferred admission to certain students who don't get in through the typical process.\\n\\nUltimately Harvard believes its campus diversity is at stake and says it couldn't achieve a rich mix of students without considering race. Its leaders also believe the suit threatens the flexibility that other courts have granted schools to build the type of student population that's best for their own campus.\\n\\nStudents for Fair Admissions believes the case could fix a system that places unfair weight on race, primarily at the expense of academically talented Asian Americans. The group's suit demands that Harvard make admissions decisions without any knowledge of students' race, and it asks for a broader ruling that the use of race in education is a civil rights violation.\\n\\nThe case is going to a bench trial, meaning it will be decided by a judge, not a jury. But the case isn't likely to end there. Whoever loses would be expected to appeal, potentially setting the stage for another Supreme Court case.\\n\\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkley\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:50:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Boston\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"42.35843"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-71.05977"},"__v":0}

They allege Correction Department officials exposed them to high levels of the radioactive gas, creating unconstitutional and inhumane conditions of confinement inside the maximum-security prison.\\n\\nA separate lawsuit was filed in state court in August by 16 former guards and staff members, several of whom suffer from respiratory ailments. It asserts the staff should have been informed of the radon problem.\\n\\n\\\"They told the current guards, but they didn't tell the retirees,\\\" said Lori Welch-Rubin, an attorney who finds herself in the unusual position of representing both prisoners and their former guards. \\\"There was one gentleman who found out two years later that he had Stage 4 lung cancer and died four months after the diagnoses. Had he known to get tested, they could have caught it earlier and saved his life.\\\"\\n\\nFrank Crose, who served as warden between 1992 and 1996, became the lead plaintiff after being diagnosed with nodules on his lungs.\\n\\nWelch-Rubin alleges the state knew about the potential for problems with radon at Garner when it was opened in 1992 but did not begin testing until 2013, when it was requested by a teacher at the prison's school. The state has required radon testing at all schools since 2003, she said.\\n\\nThose tests found extremely high levels of radon inside the classrooms, which are on the second floor, she said.\\n\\n\\\"We're talking about levels in some places that are equivalent to smoking 2 ½ packs of cigarettes a day,\\\" she said. \\\"Not just being exposed to smoke, actually smoking 2 ½ packs a day.\\\"\\n\\nConnecticut Correction Department spokesman Andrius Banevicius said the state now routinely tests for radon in the prison and recently completed the installation of a radon mitigation system there.\\n\\nThe state, he said, is reviewing the Sept. 27 decision by U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton, which rejected the state's attempt to have the federal lawsuit dismissed based on claims of qualified and sovereign immunity.\\n\\nWelch-Rubin asserts the mitigation system doesn't cover all areas of the prison and used pipes that were too small to properly vent the gas, which is naturally occurring and seeps into the prison from the surrounding bedrock. She plans to seek class-action status for the lawsuit on behalf of all inmates who have been housed at Garner.\\n\\nAfter the 2013 testing, she said, current guards were told to get a baseline chest X-ray and file forms that would allow them to seek workers compensation if they develop health problems in the future.\\n\\n\\\"They still haven't tested where the prisoners are,\\\" she said, \\\"so we don't know if what they are now doing is even adequate.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:49:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Hartford, Connecticut\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.76371"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-72.68509"},"__v":0}

Houston police officers got a 7 percent pay raise earlier this month.\\n\\nMayor Sylvester Turner says he respects firefighters, but that the proposal would cost too much. The city estimates the initial cost at up to $100 million. Turner says city services would have to be cut and hundreds of city workers, including first responders, would lose their jobs.\\n\\nMarty Lancton, president of the Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association, calls Turner's dire financial warnings a \\\"phony budget crisis.\\\" Lancton has questioned the changing figures the city has used to calculate the price tag, but he didn't offer his own cost estimate.\\n\\nLancton said some firefighters have to work two or three jobs to support their families.\\n\\n\\\"When you don't equally value the service and sacrifice of firefighters just like you do police officers, you fail to make public safety the No. 1 priority,\\\" Lancton said.\\n\\nThe plan calls for firefighters and police officers of similar rank or status to be paid equally. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the concept is as old as the two professions, but pay parity has steadily eroded since the 1950s. Several large U.S. cities, including Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York still have pay parity between firefighters and police officers.\\n\\nAccording to data from the International Association of Fire Fighters, the starting salary of a firefighter in Houston is $40,170; in Phoenix it's $48,526; in Chicago it's $56,304; and in Los Angeles it's $72,704.\\n\\nAmong Texas' largest cities, Austin, Fort Worth and San Antonio all have higher starting firefighter salaries. Last month, Dallas, boosted the starting pay of its firefighters to $60,000.\\n\\nIn Houston, a firefighter trainee's salary is $28,024 while a police cadet's salary is $42,000. After graduating from the police academy, the salary goes up to nearly $50,000.\\n\\nThe battle over pay follows a bitter fight over pension reform, led by Turner, to reduce the city's huge pension debt. Amid the ongoing tension, two firefighters last year snubbed Turner by not shaking his hand at public events.\\n\\nAfter the most recent contract negotiations failed, Houston firefighters submitted a petition to the city in July 2017 to put the pay parity measure on the ballot. Firefighters accused Turner's administration of slow-walking the petition's verification process and preventing it from being validated in time for the November 2017 election. They later filed a lawsuit to get the measure on this year's ballot.\\n\\nTurner, who's campaigned against the referendum at town hall meetings and on social media, says firefighters would need a 29 percent pay hike to bring them in line with police officers.\\n\\n\\\"I love the firefighters. I respect what they do,\\\" Turner said at a town hall meeting Tuesday. \\\"But the city cannot afford to give any employee group anything close to a 29 percent pay raise.\\\"\\n\\nTurner said that between 2005 and 2010, firefighters received raises totaling about 34 percent. He says the city has offered a 9.5 percent pay raise that is still on the table.\\n\\nThose against the measure include local business groups, Democratic and Republican officials, and the union representing police officers, he said. The union representing municipal workers has said it doesn't oppose the measure.\\n\\nBrandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston, believes the ballot measure has a good chance of being approved because of the \\\"positive view most people have of first responders, especially firefighters.\\\"\\n\\nWhile both sides still have incentives to find an equitable solution to the pay dispute, the \\\"poisoned\\\" relationship between the two sides might ultimately make that too difficult to achieve, Rottinghaus said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nThis story has been corrected to show that the union representing municipal workers has said it doesn't oppose the measure.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Juan A.

It was a dig at the GOP health bill that McSally supported for containing what she calls an \\\"age tax\\\" -- a provision allowing insurance companies to charge people ages 50 to 64 who buy insurance on health exchanges rates five times higher than younger consumers. Under the ACA, the limit is three times higher.\\n\\nIn an interview, Sinema described her health care agenda as mainly a fight to preserve popular parts of the Affordable Care Act. She said she didn't like everything about the bill and noted she'd sponsored bills delaying or repealing some of its funding mechanisms -- taxes on medical devices and health insurance.\\n\\nMcSally instead focuses on the shortcomings of the law, blaming it for driving up health premiums for small businesses and other consumers and arguing Republicans are just trying to make things better. She bristles at the \\\"age tax\\\" attacks because she wrote an amendment adding $90 billion in subsidies for older consumers to protect against higher insurance rates. Although the GOP health bill did contain provisions that weakened the ACA's protections of pre-existing conditions, McSally calls pre-existing conditions \\\"a line in the sand\\\" that she'll protect.\\n\\n\\\"We've all got people in our lives who struggle with chronic disease,\\\" McSally said. \\\"It's personal for all of us.

This is the first study to differentiate postpartum pain from labor and delivery pain and identify it as a significant risk factor for postpartum depression.\\n\\n\\\"For many years, we have been concerned about how to manage labor pain, but recovery pain after labor and delivery often is overlooked,\\\" said Jie Zhou, M.D., M.B.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor of anesthesia at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston. \\\"Our research suggests we need to focus more on helping new mothers manage pain after the baby is born.\\\"\\n\\nSymptoms of postpartum depression - including extreme sadness, low energy, anxiety, crying episodes, irritability and changes in sleep or eating patterns - affect about 1 in 9 women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Postpartum depression can lead to lower rates of breastfeeding and poor bonding with the baby.\\n\\nIn the study, Dr. Zhou's research group reviewed pain scores (from the start of labor to hospital discharge) for 4,327 first-time mothers delivering a single child vaginally or by cesarean delivery (C-section) at Brigham and Women's Hospital between June 1, 2015 and Dec. 31, 2017. They compared pain scores to the mothers' Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) scores one week after delivery.\\n\\nDr. Zhou found postpartum depression was significantly associated with higher postpartum pain scores. Mothers with postpartum depression demonstrated more pain-related complaints during recovery and often needed additional pain medication. Women in the postpartum depression group were more likely to have delivered by C-section. They also had more reports of inadequate postpartum pain control.\\n\\nA number of factors can contribute to postpartum depression. Researchers determined postpartum depression was higher among women who were overweight or obese; who suffered from a torn perineum (the area adjacent to the vaginal opening); who had a history of depression, anxiety or chronic pain; and whose babies were smaller and had lower Apgar scores, a scoring system used to assess the physical health of newborns one minute and five minutes after birth.\\n\\n\\\"While ibuprofen and similar pain medications are considered adequate for pain control after childbirth, clearly some women need additional help managing pain,\\\" said Dr. Zhou. \\\"We need to do a better job identifying who is at risk for postpartum pain and ensure they have adequate postpartum care.\\\"\\n\\nFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology.

And if you have to suffer through your own internal revolution of change out of love, then it's worth going through it,\\\" he told CNS.\\n\\nThe Mass preceded a conference and a concert sponsored by Caritas Internationalis celebrating the Oct. 14 canonizations of both St. Romero and St. Paul VI.\\n\\nCardinal Tagle, president of Caritas Internationalis, presided at the vigil Mass along with Cardinals Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador.\\n\\nHolding back tears, Cardinal Tagle said in his homily that true Christians give witness not to an ethic or a law, but \\\"a person, Jesus who loved me, who gave his life for us and I experienced this love, this charity!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And when I live by that love, my life becomes a testimony to the gift I have received,\\\" he added. \\\"And death does not become the annihilation of life, but death becomes the apex of life. When we love, we live. But when we love, we also die. But it is in dying that we live.\\\"\\n\\nCardinal Rodriguez said St. Romero's canonization wasn't just a reason for El Salvador to celebrate but for all Central America and that \\\"it also is a reason to hope.\\\"\\n\\nSt. Romero \\\"simply took up his cross,\\\" the cardinal said, \\\"and it was a heavy cross because (it was) the cross of his brothers (bishops) who didn't support him -- because there were very few who supported him -- and even in the midst of that, he knew how to go forward until he triumphed.\\\"\\n\\nFor Manuel Roberto Lopez, El Salvador's ambassador to the Holy See, there is only one word that comes to mind as a Salvadoran witnessing the beloved archbishop's canonization: a blessing.\\n\\n\\\"That's the word that comes to mind because I feel that it is a blessing that comes from heaven not only for Salvadorans, it's for all Latin America, for the whole world,\\\" Lopez told CNS.\\n\\n\\\"I hope the Salvadoran people, especially young people, understand this message and they can truly live out the teachings of Romero because, if not, his blood will be shed for nothing,\\\" he said. \\\"St. Romero is waiting for that fruit from us.\\\"\\n\\nArchbishop Vincenzo Paglia, postulator for St. Romero's sainthood cause, said he believed the canonization of the Salvadoran archbishop and of St. Paul VI marks a turning point for the Catholic Church.\\n\\n\\\"For me, this is not only a beautiful celebration,\\\" Archbishop Paglia told CNS Oct. 13. The canonizations mark \\\"a new step for the church.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There will be three people, two who are in heaven and one on earth: Paul VI, Romero and Pope Francis, who all admire each other,\\\" the archbishop said. \\\"This tryptic is explosive, and for me, the message is very clear: This is a church that has chosen to blend with history and with the preference of the poor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What the cardinals and priests who opposed (St. Romero's canonization) don't understand is that (St. Romero's) faith was not theoretical, it was a faith blended with current times, charity, justice and the forces of a changing world,\\\" Archbishop Paglia said.\\n\\nBefore sunrise Oct. 14 thousands of pilgrims stood in line to enter St. Peter's Square for the canonization Mass; many of them were wearing white and blue scarves and hats, the colors of El Salvador's flag.\\n\\n\\\"We have been waiting since midnight and we haven't slept because we want to be among those privileged to be here for the 6 million Salvadorans who wanted to come,\\\" Jose Antonio Garcia Garcia, a Salvadoran pilgrim living in Rome, told CNS.\\n\\n\\\"It is a historic event, a transcendental day,\\\" Liliana Emeldy Reyes, another pilgrim who traveled from El Salvador, told CNS.\\n\\nAs St. Romero is known for defending the poor and the victims of El Salvador's military repression in the 1970s, some viewed his legacy as politicized. Reyes told CNS she was among those who had a negative opinion of him until a few years ago.\\n\\n\\\"Many people would say that he was polarizing and that he wasn't a universal person but only fighting for the left,\\\" Reyes told CNS. She changed her mind when she met pilgrims who traveled to El Salvador for his beatification in 2015. \\\"Now I know that he is a just man,\\\" she said.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:47:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Rome\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.89193"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"12.51133"},"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc35c60ffe04444c46fbe5a"},"title":"\"New strategy: Democrats go all-in on health care in midterms\"","body":"\"PHOENIX -- In a windowless conference room, Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally was asking executives at a small crane manufacturing company how the GOP tax cut has helped their business when one woman said: \\\"I want to ask you a question about health care.\\\"\\n\\nMarylea Evans recounted how, decades ago, her husband had been unable to get health insurance after developing cancer, forcing the couple to sell some of their Texas ranch to pay for his treatment. Now she was worried about Democratic ads saying McSally, currently a congresswoman, supported legislation removing the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.\\n\\n\\\"It's a lie,\\\" McSally said quickly, accustomed to having to interrupt a discussion of the tax cut to parry attacks on health care.\\n\\nThe exchange demonstrated how Democratic arguments about health care are resonating with voters in the final weeks before the midterm elections. While Democratic enthusiasm this year has largely been fueled by anger toward President Donald Trump, candidates have targeted their messaging to focus more on health care.\\n\\nIt's the subject of the greatest share of political ads on television now, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, and a top issue in campaigns from Virginia to Arkansas to California -- and especially in Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema has made it the foundation of her Senate campaign against McSally.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats believe that health care is the issue that's going to deliver them the majority,\\\" said Nathan Gonzalez, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections. \\\"In 2016, Democrats learned that going all-in against Trump was not the right strategy, so they're trying to be more specific.\\\"\\n\\nThe Democratic furor around health care comes from Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans, including McSally, voted for a wide-ranging bill that would have, among other things, undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions and drastically changed and shrunk Medicaid. The Senate never took up the bill, and its own attempt to reverse the health care law failed by one vote.\\n\\nThis year, the Trump administration supported a group of GOP attorneys general who filed a lawsuit arguing the ACA is unconstitutional. The administration singled out protection for pre-existing conditions as unsustainable.\\n\\nDemocrats are effectively performing political judo on the GOP, who blistered them over four elections for messing up voters' health care with the Affordable Care Act and vowed a hasty repeal once they were back in power. Now that the GOP tried and failed to change health care, Democrats are pouncing.\\n\\n\\\"You see in every survey, whether it's a Senate race in a red state or a House race in a purple district, health care is the No. 1 issue,\\\" said Patrick McHugh of Priorities USA, a major Democratic campaign group. \\\"One party wants to actually expand health care coverage and reduce costs, and the other party campaigned claiming they did, but when they got into power, they did not.\\\"\\n\\nIn Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is defending her seat by highlighting that her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, signed onto the lawsuit over pre-existing conditions. In Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin aired an ad showing her mother dying of cancer and called incumbent Republican Rep.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc35c60ffe04444c46fbe5b"},"title":"\"Immigrants face hurdles to prove abuse by US agents\"","body":"\"HOUSTON -- Within hours of being booked at a Border Patrol station in far West Texas, two teenage sisters from Guatemala came forward to allege that an agent conducted an improper strip search.\\n\\nThe agent in question denied the allegations, including the sisters' claims that he touched their genitals. He insisted he had only fingerprinted the sisters before taking them back to their cell.\\n\\nInvestigating the case came down to the sisters' word versus the agent's. And as in dozens of similar cases, government investigators sided with the agent.\\n\\nAdvocates say the case -- outlined in a report compiled by internal investigators -- shows the kinds of hurdles detained immigrants face when they make claims of misconduct, even when they come forward immediately, as the sisters did.\\n\\n\\\"These women were actually, for lack of a better word, lucky that their case was investigated,\\\" said Christina Mansfield, co-founder of the advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants. \\\"They are in the extreme minority in that regard.\\\"\\n\\nThe sisters, ages 17 and 19, entered the U.S. without legal permission in July 2016, several days after leaving their home village in Guatemala. They were detained by Border Patrol agents shortly after crossing the border.\\n\\nThe Associated Press received a redacted copy of the investigative report through the Freedom of Information Act. It shows that investigators determined that the sisters' allegations could not be substantiated due to a lack of physical evidence.\\n\\nThe station where the sisters were detained did not have cameras in the booking area. The room where the sisters say they were taken, later described as a supply room or a closet, wasn't processed for fingerprints because the sisters said they didn't touch anything. And the agent in question said he was alone with the sisters due to manpower shortages, the report says.\\n\\nImmigration advocates say the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, which reviewed the sisters' case, rarely recommends action against officers. A study by Freedom for Immigrants found that between January 2010 and July 2016, the inspector general received 84 complaints of coerced sexual contact against U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol. The inspector general opened just seven investigations, none of which are known to have led to charges, according to the study, which was conducted by examining government records.\\n\\nThe study found a similarly low number of cases were investigated by the inspector general for detention facilities operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nCBP would not directly address the sisters' case or whether it disciplined the agent involved. The agency said it was committed to treating detainees with \\\"professionalism and courtesy.\\\"\\n\\nImmigration authorities detain and process thousands of people every month who cross the U.S. border without permission. Border Patrol chief Carla Provost said in a recent interview that her agency takes any allegations against any of its 19,000 agents \\\"very, very seriously.\\\" Provost previously led CBP's internal affairs division, which also investigates allegations of employee wrongdoing and that the agency has taken steps to strengthen in recent years.\\n\\n\\\"They are very few and far between,\\\" she said, speaking generally about misconduct complaints.\\n\\nThe sisters were taken by agents to the Presidio Border Patrol station and booked into the same holding cell. The agents who detained them went out on another call.\\n\\nAccording to the report, a third agent then took the elder sister out of the cell. He told investigators that he processed and fingerprinted each of them before returning them to their cell.\\n\\nThe elder sister told a different story. She said the agent took her into a back room that had a table filled with snacks and drinks. There, she says, the agent told her to lift her sweater and dress. The woman said that after a small photograph fell out of her bra, the agent pulled up her bra. Then, she said, he told her to remove her pants and underwear, then touched her genitals with the outer part of his hand.\\n\\nThe younger sister would accuse the agent of conducting a similar search.\\n\\nBorder Patrol guidelines prohibit male agents to strip-search female detainees \\\"except in exigent circumstances,\\\" and only then with another agent present to observe. Under the guidelines, a vaginal cavity search must be done by a medical professional at a medical facility.\\n\\nWhen the agent later heard one of the sisters accusing him of misconduct, the report says, he \\\"became upset and told the girl he didn't make her do that.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to the investigators' report, one agent said that \\\"this is exactly the reason cameras are needed in the processing area.\\\"\\n\\nThe accused agent would speak to investigators three times. The last time, an investigator noted the agent \\\"appeared to be nervous and removed,\\\" and he \\\"had to constantly review a prepared statement\\\" from his initial interview. But a month after the last interview, investigators took their case to a federal prosecutor, James Miller, who agreed with their conclusion that there was a \\\"lack of evidence.\\\"\\n\\nMiller declined to comment on why he didn't pursue a prosecution.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5bc35c60ffe04444c46fbe67"},"title":"\"New strategy: Democrats go all-in on health care in midterms\"","body":"\"PHOENIX (AP) -- In a windowless conference room, Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally was asking executives at a small crane manufacturing company how the GOP tax cut has helped their business when one woman said: \\\"I want to ask you a question about health care.\\\"\\n\\nMarylea Evans recounted how, decades ago, her husband had been unable to get health insurance after developing cancer, forcing the couple to sell some of their Texas ranch to pay for his treatment. Now she was worried about Democratic ads saying McSally, currently a congresswoman, supported legislation removing the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.\\n\\n\\\"It's a lie,\\\" McSally said quickly, accustomed to having to interrupt a discussion of the tax cut to parry attacks on health care.\\n\\nThe exchange demonstrated how Democratic arguments about health care are resonating with voters in the final weeks before the midterm elections. While Democratic enthusiasm this year has largely been fueled by anger toward President Donald Trump, candidates have targeted their messaging to focus more on health care.\\n\\nIt's the subject of the greatest share of political ads on television now, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, and a top issue in campaigns from Virginia to Arkansas to California -- and especially in Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema has made it the foundation of her Senate campaign against McSally.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats believe that health care is the issue that's going to deliver them the majority,\\\" said Nathan Gonzalez, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections. \\\"In 2016, Democrats learned that going all-in against Trump was not the right strategy, so they're trying to be more specific.\\\"\\n\\nThe Democratic furor around health care comes from Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans, including McSally, voted for a wide-ranging bill that would have, among other things, undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions and drastically changed and shrunk Medicaid. The Senate never took up the bill, and its own attempt to reverse the health care law failed by one vote.\\n\\nThis year, the Trump administration supported a group of GOP attorneys general who filed a lawsuit arguing the ACA is unconstitutional. The administration singled out protection for pre-existing conditions as unsustainable.\\n\\nDemocrats are effectively performing political judo on the GOP, who blistered them over four elections for messing up voters' health care with the Affordable Care Act and vowed a hasty repeal once they were back in power. Now that the GOP tried and failed to change health care, Democrats are pouncing.\\n\\n\\\"You see in every survey, whether it's a Senate race in a red state or a House race in a purple district, health care is the No. 1 issue,\\\" said Patrick McHugh of Priorities USA, a major Democratic campaign group. \\\"One party wants to actually expand health care coverage and reduce costs, and the other party campaigned claiming they did, but when they got into power, they did not.\\\"\\n\\nIn Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is defending her seat by highlighting that her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, signed onto the lawsuit over pre-existing conditions. In Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin aired an ad showing her mother dying of cancer and called incumbent Republican Rep. Mike Bishop's vote for the GOP health bill \\\"dereliction of duty.\\\" In Arizona, Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, a physician, is running against Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko after shocking the political world by barely losing an April special election for the seat on a health care platform.\\n\\nGlen Bolger, a Republican pollster, notes that health care is a perennial Democratic base issue but acknowledges it appears especially potent this year. However, he said, Republicans have a possible counter -- pushing back against some Democrats' support for a single-payer system that would require higher taxes.\\n\\n\\\"That, as a pushback message, tests very well,\\\" Bolger said.\\n\\nRepublicans have used it in races where Democratic challengers have backed the policy -- such as against Katie Porter, an attorney challenging Republican Rep. Mimi Walters in Southern California, or against social worker Kara Eastman, who's leaned heavily on single payer in her challenge to Rep. Don Bacon in Nebraska. The GOP has even levied the charge against Democrats who haven't supported a single-payer program, like Abigail Spanberger, who's challenging Rep. David Brat in Virginia.\\n\\nGonzalez said the GOP responses show they're fighting on Democrats' turf and keeping the GOP from cashing in politically on the growing economy.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats believe that health care is the antidote to Republican talk about the economy,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe Arizona Senate contest provides a microcosm of the issue. Democrats started hitting McSally on health care with an ad barrage from a dark-money group during the GOP primary and have not let up, accusing her of trying to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and charge older people more for health insurance. Sinema mentions the issue everywhere she goes.\\n\\n\\\"We have a chance to elect a United States senator who understands Leslie's struggles to make sure she gets access to the important medication she needs and that she's not discriminated against because of having a pre-existing health condition,\\\" Sinema said at a recent appearance to rally volunteers in Scottsdale. It was a dig at the GOP health bill that McSally supported for containing what she calls an \\\"age tax\\\" -- a provision allowing insurance companies to charge people ages 50 to 64 who buy insurance on health exchanges rates five times higher than younger consumers. Under the ACA, the limit is three times higher.\\n\\nIn an interview, Sinema described her health care agenda as mainly a fight to preserve popular parts of the Affordable Care Act. She said she didn't like everything about the bill and noted she'd sponsored bills delaying or repealing some of its funding mechanisms -- taxes on medical devices and health insurance.\\n\\nMcSally instead focuses on the shortcomings of the law, blaming it for driving up health premiums for small businesses and other consumers and arguing Republicans are just trying to make things better. She bristles at the \\\"age tax\\\" attacks because she wrote an amendment adding $90 billion in subsidies for older consumers to protect against higher insurance rates. Although the GOP health bill did contain provisions that weakened the ACA's protections of pre-existing conditions, McSally calls pre-existing conditions \\\"a line in the sand\\\" that she'll protect.\\n\\n\\\"We've all got people in our lives who struggle with chronic disease,\\\" McSally said. \\\"It's personal for all of us. The Democrats are taking this line of attack because they know health care is personal.\\\"\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:44:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Phoenix, Arizona\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"33.44838"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-112.07404"},"__v":0}

It'll also be the Corpus Christi, Texas, native's first trip to the nation's capital.\\n\\nBut amid all that excitement, one could probably forgive him if he doesn't run quite as well as he had originally hoped, since training for the race has fallen somewhat on his list of priorities. Rodriguez is stationed at Camp Lejeune, in North Carolina, and Hurricane Florence made landfall only about 50 miles south of his home in the nearby city of Jacksonville.\\n\\n\\\"We're trying to stay with it,\\\" he admitted. \\\"Right now (his wife) Susanna is a lot more committed than I am.\\\"\\n\\nSusanna Rodriguez used to be an active duty Marine, too. In fact, that's how the two met; and it's why they chose to run this race together.\\n\\n\\\"We met as young Marines, and after that we continued to be friends throughout the Marine Corps,\\\" he said. \\\"It's had a big, big role in our lives as a family.\\\"\\n\\nSusanna retired from active duty about 1 1/2 years ago so she could be at home to help raise their three children.\\n\\n\\\"At one point when we were in Okinawa, Japan, we would drive home from work and I'd be upstairs giving the kids a bath, she'd be downstairs doing the dishes, cleaning up the house, getting ready for work the next day. After that, we'd swap out.\\\"\\n\\nKevin said parenting, work as active duty military, trying to take college classes and general home life was a balancing act in which Kevin felt they weren't spending as much time with the kids as they both would have hoped.\\n\\n\\\"Pressure makes diamonds, and we grow through adversity. The Marine Corps really put a lot of pressure on us, but at the same time we were able to respond the best we could and we made the best of what we had. The Marine Corps really made us grow a lot, and we grow a lot more appreciation for the things that we have.\\\"\\n\\nIn fact, Kevin admits that even beyond planting the seeds for his family, \\\"it's really given me a lot of opportunities, and it's opened up a lot of doors for things that wouldn't have been available,\\\" things, he said, he has greater appreciation for.\\n\\nBut at the same time, having a spouse who was also in the military means being with someone who understands what he's going through at work. And having been at home with their kids, he understands why she's ready for a break when he gets home.\\n\\n\\\"So long as I give mama bear that time for her to go to the gym or for her to go run, she's happy,\\\" he joked. \\\"So, I try to give that to her.\\\"\\n\\nIt's time Kevin hasn't had much of lately. After the storm hit, he took leave so he could make the repairs he needed at his house, which suffered some water damage but escaped the worst.\\n\\n\\\"Looking back at the hurricane, you realize your priorities really, really shift in a state of emergency,\\\" Kevin said. \\\"Now that we have our house all square, for the most part . we're very, very fortunate. There's a lot of families out there who, man, they got flooded. You see all their belongings out on the curb. Fortunately we didn't have to take anything out to the curb. There's no reason for us to complain.\\\"\\n\\nKevin has been lending a hand to others still picking up the pieces.\\n\\n\\\"Luckily, I have the skills to do some of those odd jobs like roofing and fencing and stuff like that,\\\" he said in September. \\\"Some people around the area just need a couple of panels put up, so a little money here, a little money there, it really helps out -- it's just backbreaking work.\\\"\\n\\nBut the storm has shown him again how to appreciate what he has, much like deployments to the Middle East and orders to Japan have shown him in the past. He'll never take a warm shower for granted again, for instance. His love of the Marines, his wife, and his life in general are why Kevin is running, and why Susanna is going to run with him -- if not past him -- in this race.\\n\\nAbout a month before the race, Kevin confided that amid all the hurricane cleanup happening around him, \\\"I kind of fell off the training regimen. I'm hoping to hop back on with a month out.\\\"\\n\\nThe buildup to the race was one more way the Marine Corps was going to bring him closer to his wife.

But both the White House and the kingdom are under mounting pressure as concern grows over the fate of the veteran journalist, who hasn't been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\\n\\nAlready, international business leaders are pulling out of the kingdom's upcoming investment forum, a high-profile event known as \\\"Davos in the Desert.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures or repeating false accusations,\\\" the statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency read. \\\"The kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action, and that the kingdom's economy has an influential and vital role in the global economy.\\\"\\n\\nThe statement from the world's top oil exporter came after the Tadawul exchange in Riyadh dropped by 7 percent at one point during the week's first day of trading, with 182 of its 186 listed stocks showing losses by the early afternoon. The market clawed back some of the losses, closing down 3.5 percent for the day.\\n\\nTurkish officials say they fear Saudi agents killed and dismembered Khashoggi after he entered the consulate, saying they have audio and video recordings of it that they have not released.

Could it be them? Yes.\\\"\\n\\nOther stock exchanges in the Mideast saw far less volatility Sunday. U.S. markets have been rattled by rising interest rates, signs of a slowdown in the global economy and the U.S.-China trade dispute.\\n\\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has aggressively pitched the kingdom as a destination for foreign investment.

The sale is a \\\"tremendous order for our companies,\\\" and if the kingdom doesn't buy its weaponry from the United States, they will buy it from others, he said. Trump said he would meet with Khashoggi's family.\\n\\nAmerican lawmakers in both parties have been more critical of Saudi Arabia, with several suggesting officials in the kingdom could be sanctioned if they were found to be involved in Khashoggi's disappearance and alleged killing.\\n\\nKhashoggi, who was considered close to the Saudi royal family, had become a critic of the current government and Prince Mohammed, the 33-year-old heir apparent who has shown little tolerance for criticism.\\n\\nAs a contributor to the Post, Khashoggi has written extensively about Saudi Arabia, including criticism of its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women's rights activists after the lifting of a ban on women driving.\\n\\nThose policies are all seen as initiatives of the crown prince, who has also presided over a roundup of activists and businessmen.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Saudi Arabia and King Salman over rising global oil prices.

Perhaps the educational philosophy of \\\"constructivist\\\" learning -- which means that students create their own knowledge based on their own experiences -- just isn't moving the needle.\\n\\nBut none of those exactly explain why, as the WWNFF's survey noted, people 65 years and older scored the best. Only 19 percent of people under 45 passed the quiz, with 81 percent scoring a 59 percent or lower.\\n\\nIronically, there is a little-known subsection of the American population that has passed a similar test -- 10 questions on U.S. civics from a pool of 100 questions -- and there's no question that they did so because passing was deeply personally meaningful to them.\\n\\nI'm speaking, of course, about naturalized U.S. citizens.\\n\\nThey take a speaking, reading, writing and civics test as just a small part of their application for citizenship. Then, at their ceremony, they swear to support our Constitution, renounce allegiance to all other countries, and vow to bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law.\\n\\nSo how can we make civics and history personally meaningful to young people in school and to the adults who are navigating the governmental structures that have so much influence over nearly every aspect of their lives?\\n\\nThere may be no alternative. As climate change-related weather events decimate whole regions of our country, trade pacts continue to reshape the American economy and voter behavior keeps being threatened by partisan lawmaking and foreign interference, we will need to hold our elected leaders accountable for ensuring that we aren't doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.\\n\\nWhether you live in a rural area that doesn't have adequate internet connectivity or in an urban enclave where clean, lead- and chemical-free water isn't readily available, chances are you're part of a community that needs to know how its government works now more than ever.\\n\\nEvery impending disaster has the potential to also be an interesting opportunity. You can either feel as though the country you grew up in and love is changing too quickly for you to adapt and thrive, or you can commit yourself to understanding how we got here and how, together, we can change direction for the better.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:36:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Chicago\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.85003"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-87.65005"},"__v":0}

(AP) -- Search and rescue personnel are continuing to comb through the ruins of a small Florida Panhandle community destroyed by Hurricane Michael, which has left hundreds thousands without power and without easy access to supplies.\\n\\nSo far, one body has been found in Mexico Beach, but authorities say there is little doubt the death toll will rise.\\n\\nCrews with dogs went door-to-door Saturday in Mexico Beach, pushing aside debris to get inside badly damaged structures in a second wave of searches following what they described as an initial, \\\"hasty\\\" search of the area. About 1,700 search and rescue personnel have checked 25,000 homes, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said.\\n\\nMichael made landfall Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with 155 mph winds (249 kph) and heavy storm surge. The tally of lives lost across the South stood at 15, including the victim found in the rubble of Mexico Beach, where about 1,000 people live.\\n\\n\\\"Everything is time consuming,\\\" said Capt. Ignatius Carroll, of the South Florida Urban Search and Rescue task force. \\\"You don't want to put a rush on a thorough rescue.\\\"\\n\\nMore roads were passable along the storm-ravaged coast as crews cleared downed trees and power lines, but traffic lights remained out and there were long lines at the few open gas stations.\\n\\nAbout 4,000 members of Florida's national guard have been called up to deal with the storm, including 500 added on Saturday. Nearly 2,000 law-enforcement officials have been sent into the Panhandle.\\n\\nSchools will stay closed indefinitely, a hospital halted operations and sent 200 patients to hospitals elsewhere in Florida and in Alabama, and more than 253,000 customers in the Panhandle remain without power.\\n\\n\\\"Everybody just needs to help each other right now,\\\" Scott said after meeting with emergency responders in the Panama City area.\\n\\n\\\"You feel sorry for people,\\\" Scott said. \\\"They might have lost their house. They worry about their kids getting into school. You know, people don't sit and have a whole bunch of extra money in the bank just waiting for a disaster.\\\"\\n\\nSome residents were packing up and getting as far away as they could.\\n\\nJeff and Katrina Pearsey, with a ruined rental home in the Panama City area and no indication of when they could again earn a living, said they were heading to Bangor, Maine, where Katrina once worked as a nurse. Several trees came down on their property, including one that smashed through the roof.\\n\\n\\\"We're getting our stuff and we're going,\\\" said Jeff Pearsey, 48. \\\"We're probably done with Panama City.\\\"\\n\\nMichael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever make landfall in the U.S. While most residents fled ahead of the storm's arrival, others stayed to face the hurricane. Some barely escaped with their lives as homes were pushed off their foundations and whole neighborhoods became submerged.\\n\\nHector Morales, a 57-year-old restaurant cook, never even thought of evacuating. His mobile home wasn't on the beach but when it suddenly began floating during the hurricane, he jumped out and swam to a fishing boat and clambered aboard.\\n\\n\\\"I lost everything,\\\" Morales said. \\\"But I made it.\\\"\\n\\nHow many others were not so fortunate was still not clear. By one count, state officials said, 285 people in Mexico Beach defied mandatory evacuation orders and stayed behind. It's unclear how many people stayed behind in nearby communities.\\n\\nOne who did, Albert Blackwell, was preparing on Saturday to cover holes in the roof of his apartment and take a chain saw to trees that fell and broke his windows just outside Panama City.\\n\\n\\\"I'm the idiot that rode it out here in this place,\\\" said Blackwell, 65, sweat dripping from his face. He doesn't plan to leave; he wants to protect his home from looters.\\n\\nEmergency officials said they've received thousands of calls asking about missing people, but with cellphone service out across a wide area, they found it impossible to know who among those unaccounted for were safe but just unable to dial out to friends or family.\\n\\nFederal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long said he expected the death toll to rise. Searchers were trying to determine if the person found dead in Mexico Beach had been alone or was part of a family.\\n\\nAuthorities have set up distribution centers to dole out food and water to victims. They've also set up a triage tent to treat residents stepping on nails and cutting themselves on debris.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump announced plans to visit Florida and hard-hit Georgia early next week but didn't say what day he would arrive.

The index recovered some ground later to close 3.5% down. Stocks have dropped as much as 9% since Khashoggi disappeared on October 2 after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The losses wiped out all the market's gains in 2018, although it is still up 8% from a year ago. For more than two years, the kingdom has been on an ambitious plan to modernize and diversify its economy away from oil. The plan, known as Vision 2030 and spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aims to increase foreign investment, boost tourism and grow the private sector. According to a United Nations report earlier this year, direct foreign investment in Saudi Arabia fell to $1.4 billion in 2017, the lowest level in 14 years. Read MoreStill, the Saudi economy has been recovering from a recession and investors were encouraged earlier this year when index compiler MSCI granted the country emerging market status. That means that stocks traded in Saudi Arabia can now be included in broader funds, making it easier for investors around the world to put their money into the kingdom's economy. But the unexplained disappearance of Khashoggi, a former Saudi government adviser turned critic, has already prompted some big-name business partners to cut ties with projects that are central to Saudi's plans of building a modern economy with technology at its core.Turkish authorities claim to have evidence that Khashoggi, a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post, was murdered inside the consulate -- an accusation the kingdom strenuously denies.British billionaire Richard Branson has pulled back from two projects to develop Red Sea tourism and has suspended talks with the Saudi government about a $1 billion investment in his space companies. \\\"What has reportedly happened in Turkey ... if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi government,\\\" he said in a statement.And a huge investment conference dubbed \\\"Davos in the Desert\\\", scheduled for later this month, has seen some leading speakers and participants drop out. Most international media partners have pulled their sponsorships.President Donald Trump has vowed that the United States will get to the bottom of what happened to Khashoggi, and has warned of \\\"severe punishment\\\" if he were found to have been killed in the consulate.In a statement on Sunday, the kingdom said it rejected any threats of economic sanctions or political pressure and would retaliate accordingly.\\\"Markets start to price in a fundamental change in the nature of the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia,\\\" said Jaap Meijer, managing director and head of equity research at Arqaam Capital. \\\"We believe it is not warranted given the long term relationship between the two countries, and Saudi being the swing oil producer.\\\"Saudi Arabia has been pumping more oil into global markets to make up for a shortfall created by Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran.

It'll be just plain apathy and ignorance that finally do us in.\\n\\nLet's start with these little nuggets of information. Of the 1,000 randomly selected American adults who recently took a multiple-choice quiz:\\n\\n-- Only 13 percent knew when the U.S. Constitution was ratified, with most incorrectly thinking it occurred in 1776.\\n\\n-- 60 percent didn't know which countries the United States fought in World War II.\\n\\n-- 57 percent did not know how many justices serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\n-- Only 24 percent could correctly identify one thing Benjamin Franklin was famous for, with 37 percent believing he invented the lightbulb.\\n\\n-- 12 percent incorrectly thought Gen. Dwight Eisenhower led troops in the Civil War; 6 percent thought he was a commander in the Vietnam War. (He served in WWII.)\\n\\nI could go on with more startling results from the quiz conducted by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation (WWNFF) but, frankly, it's too depressing.\\n\\nThis level of cluelessness doesn't just happen in a vacuum. It's been coming on for some time as civics education has gotten crowded out of public school curricula by an increased push to get more kids proficient in reading, math and writing.\\n\\nWe'll have to wait until next year to learn how our nation's students fared on the National Assessment of Educational Progress civics assessment in 2018 -- the test is administered every four years -- but the 2014 test was a sad scene.\\n\\nScores among 8th graders showed no improvement from their dismal level in 2010. Less than one-quarter of students scored at the level of \\\"proficient\\\" or better, and only about half said they found their civics coursework interesting \\\"often\\\" or \\\"always.\\\"\\n\\nNo one knows where the blame lies for today's students being low-performing in civics.\\n\\nIt could be anything from poor teaching to the educational trend of telling students that rote memorization is unnecessary in the age of the internet search engine. Perhaps the educational philosophy of \\\"constructivist\\\" learning -- which means that students create their own knowledge based on their own experiences -- just isn't moving the needle.\\n\\nBut none of those exactly explain why, as the WWNFF's survey noted, people 65 years and older scored the best. Only 19 percent of people under 45 passed the quiz, with 81 percent scoring a 59 percent or lower.\\n\\nIronically, there is a little-known subsection of the American population that has passed a similar test -- 10 questions on U.S. civics from a pool of 100 questions -- and there's no question that they did so because passing was deeply personally meaningful to them.\\n\\nI'm speaking, of course, about naturalized U.S. citizens.\\n\\nThey take a speaking, reading, writing and civics test as just a small part of their application for citizenship. Then, at their ceremony, they swear to support our Constitution, renounce allegiance to all other countries, and vow to bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law.\\n\\nSo how can we make civics and history personally meaningful to young people in school and to the adults who are navigating the governmental structures that have so much influence over nearly every aspect of their lives?\\n\\nThere may be no alternative. As climate change-related weather events decimate whole regions of our country, trade pacts continue to reshape the American economy and voter behavior keeps being threatened by partisan lawmaking and foreign interference, we will need to hold our elected leaders accountable for ensuring that we aren't doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.\\n\\nWhether you live in a rural area that doesn't have adequate internet connectivity or in an urban enclave where clean, lead- and chemical-free water isn't readily available, chances are you're part of a community that needs to know how its government works now more than ever.\\n\\nEvery impending disaster has the potential to also be an interesting opportunity. You can either feel as though the country you grew up in and love is changing too quickly for you to adapt and thrive, or you can commit yourself to understanding how we got here and how, together, we can change direction for the better.\"","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T14:31:00.000Z"},"location":"\"Chicago\"","lat":{"$numberDecimal":"41.85003"},"lng":{"$numberDecimal":"-87.65005"},"__v":0}
